2. [Molecules](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/#molecules)
3. [Organisms](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/#organisms)
4. [Templates ](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/#templates)
5. [Pages ](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/#pages)



##### Atoms

HTML tags, such as a form label, an input or a button.

##### Molecules

Molecules are groups of atoms bonded together and are the smallest fundamental units of a compound.

##### Organisms

Organisms are groups of  molecules joined together to form a relatively complex, distinct section of an interface.

##### Templates

Templates consist mostly of groups of organisms stitched together to  form pages.

##### Pages

Pages are specific instances of templates.
