A weakness example - like to jump right into things, and so that's why I like looking more at architectural  diagrams to try and think about the bigger picture.

### Questions to ask

Ask questions that draw upon your own experience that might be relevant for the role.

Often draw upon challenges you might have or that you've experienced. 

Look at people's linkedin and ask them about their background.

Examples:

1. Say I'm talking with a startup. A question I might ask an eng manager is how they deal with balancing tech debt with fast iteration cycles, or how they deal with the dynamic between design, engineering, product, sales.
2. I asked this question a few days after a couple of AWS outages hit the news - how do you plan on preparing for future outages?
3. For a product person, I might ask about their new UI release that does xyz and ask how DS/eng influenced the approach (i.e. again dynamic between product, eng).
4. Advice related questions are always good, such as advice given to yourself xxx years ago, etc
5. Some people come from different majors, backgrounds, etc into engineering/DS/whatever. I like to ask them about that - what drew them in, what parallels do they see, etc.
6. Ask about their time with the company, what they liked, what they don't like as much, challenges, etc
