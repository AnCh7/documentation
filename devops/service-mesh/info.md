# What's a service mesh?

A service mesh is a dedicated infrastructure layer built right into an app. This visible infrastructure layer can document how well (or not) different parts of an app interact.

A service mesh is built into an app as an array of network proxies. Individual proxies that make up a service mesh are sometimes called "sidecars".

Service mesh captures every aspect of service-to-service communication as performance metrics.
