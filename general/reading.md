   - Traditional text retrieval methods like BM25 offer high speed but may lack accuracy. Conversely, language models provide improved accuracy at the expense of increased computational time. Balancing these factors is crucial for efficient information retrieval systems.
2. **Proposed Three-Stage Re-Ranking Model**:
   - **Stage 1**: Utilize BM25 to rank all documents in the corpus, selecting the top *a1* documents with the highest similarity to the query.
   - **Stage 2**: Apply a language model to re-rank these *a1* documents, narrowing down to the top *a2* documents.
   - **Stage 3**: Further re-rank the a2 documents using either a model ensemble or a larger language model to achieve the final ranking.
3. **Advantages Over Pairwise Models**:
   - Previous methods employed pairwise language models in the final stage, which compared document pairs to determine relevance. However, this approach is computationally intensive, requiring comparisons that scale quadratically with the number of documents (e.g., 90 inferences for 10 documents). The proposed method reduces computational complexity by focusing on individual document-query similarities.
4. **Experimental Evaluation**:
   - The authors trained the MiniLM language model on the MS-MARCO dataset and evaluated it in a zero-shot setting using BEIR datasets. The proposed method demonstrated higher retrieval accuracy compared to existing models, with reduced retrieval times. Notably, the three-stage model using a larger language model achieved superior search accuracy, especially on out-of-domain datasets.
5. **Implications**:
   - This study highlights the effectiveness of combining traditional retrieval methods with advanced language models in a multi-stage framework. By strategically applying models of increasing complexity, the approach balances accuracy and efficiency, making it suitable for real-world applications where both factors are critical.

### 13. Graph of Thoughts: Solving Elaborate Problems with Large Language Models

**TL;DR**: The "Graph of Thoughts" (GoT) framework enhances large language models (LLMs) by structuring reasoning processes as arbitrary graphs, surpassing traditional linear or tree-based methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree of Thoughts (ToT). This approach enables more complex and efficient problem-solving, achieving significant improvements in tasks such as sorting.

Pages: 63.

**Detailed Summary**:

The paper introduces the Graph of Thoughts (GoT) framework, which models the reasoning process of LLMs as arbitrary graphs. In this framework, individual units of information, termed "LLM thoughts," are represented as vertices, and the dependencies between them are depicted as edges. This graph-based structure allows for the combination of various thoughts into cohesive outcomes, the distillation of entire networks of thoughts, and the enhancement of reasoning through feedback loops.

GoT extends beyond the limitations of existing paradigms like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree of Thoughts (ToT), which structure reasoning in linear sequences or hierarchical trees, respectively. By adopting a more flexible graph structure, GoT more closely mirrors human cognitive processes and neural mechanisms, which often involve complex, recurrent networks.

The authors present a modular architecture for implementing GoT, emphasizing fine-grained control over individual thoughts and the ability to incorporate new thought transformations seamlessly. This design facilitates rapid prototyping of novel prompting strategies using various LLMs, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Llama-2.

Empirical evaluations demonstrate GoT's advantages over existing methods. For instance, in sorting tasks, GoT improves quality by approximately 62% compared to ToT, while also reducing associated costs by over 31%. These findings suggest that GoT is particularly effective for tasks that can be decomposed into smaller subtasks, solved individually, and then integrated into a final solution.

Additionally, the paper introduces a new metric for evaluating prompting strategies, termed the "volume of a thought." This metric quantifies the number of LLM thoughts that contribute to a particular thought, providing deeper insights into the differences between various prompting schemes.

In summary, the Graph of Thoughts framework represents a significant advancement in prompting strategies for large language models, enabling more sophisticated and efficient reasoning by leveraging arbitrary graph structures to model complex thought processes.

### 14. A Unified View of Label Shift Estimation

**TL;DR**: The paper "A Unified View of Label Shift Estimation" presents a comprehensive analysis of two primary methods for estimating label distributions under label shift: Black Box Shift Estimation (BBSE) and Maximum Likelihood Label Shift (MLLS). The authors establish consistency conditions for MLLS, unify both methods under a common framework, and decompose MLLS's finite-sample error into components related to miscalibration and estimation error. Their analysis attributes BBSE's statistical inefficiency to information loss due to coarse calibration. Empirical evaluations on synthetic data, MNIST, and CIFAR-10 support their findings.

Pages: 11.

**Detailed Summary**:

The paper addresses the challenge of label shift, where the distribution of labels changes between the source and target domains, while the class-conditional distributions remain constant. This scenario is common in real-world applications, such as medical diagnostics, where the prevalence of diseases (labels) may vary over time or across populations, but the manifestation of symptoms (features) given a disease remains consistent.

**Key Contributions**:

1. **Consistency Conditions for MLLS**: The authors establish that for MLLS to be consistent, two conditions are necessary:

   - **Calibration of the Classifier**: The classifier used must be calibrated, meaning its predicted probabilities should accurately reflect the true likelihoods.
   - **Invertible Confusion Matrix**: The confusion matrix derived from the classifier must be invertible, ensuring that the system of equations used in the estimation process has a unique solution.

2. **Unified Framework**: The paper presents a framework that encompasses both BBSE and MLLS. They demonstrate that BBSE can be viewed as equivalent to MLLS when a specific calibration method is applied. This unification provides a deeper understanding of the relationship between the two methods and offers insights into their respective advantages and limitations.

3. **Error Decomposition of MLLS**: The authors decompose the finite-sample error of MLLS into two components:

   - **Miscalibration Error**: Error arising from inaccuracies in the classifier's predicted probabilities.
   - **Estimation Error**: Error due to the finite size of the sample used in the estimation process.

   This decomposition allows for a more nuanced analysis of the factors influencing MLLS's performance and highlights the importance of classifier calibration in achieving accurate label shift estimation.

**Empirical Findings**:

Through experiments on synthetic datasets, as well as the MNIST and CIFAR-10 image datasets, the authors demonstrate that:

- MLLS, when combined with appropriate calibration techniques, outperforms BBSE in terms of estimation accuracy.
- The superior performance of MLLS is primarily due to its ability to retain more information during the calibration process, whereas BBSE's reliance on confusion matrices leads to a loss of information and, consequently, reduced statistical efficiency.

**Conclusion**:

The paper provides a comprehensive theoretical and empirical analysis of label shift estimation methods, offering valuable insights into the conditions necessary for their success. By unifying BBSE and MLLS under a common framework and elucidating the importance of classifier calibration, the authors contribute to a deeper understanding of domain adaptation techniques in machine learning.

### 15. Practical Benefits of Feature Feedback Under Distribution Shift

**TL;DR**: The paper "Practical Benefits of Feature Feedback Under Distribution Shift" investigates how incorporating feature feedback—auxiliary annotations highlighting salient evidence—affects model performance, particularly under distribution shifts. While feature feedback has shown limited benefits on in-domain test sets, this study finds that, in sentiment analysis tasks, models utilizing feature feedback significantly outperform standard models on out-of-domain datasets, despite similar in-domain performance. However, in natural language inference (NLI) tasks, feature feedback does not yield notable improvements. The research suggests that feature feedback can enhance model robustness to distribution shifts in certain tasks, with effectiveness varying by domain.

Pages: 10.

**Detailed Summary**:

The study explores the utility of feature feedback—annotations provided during training that highlight important parts of the input, such as specific spans in text—for improving model robustness, especially when facing distribution shifts. Previous research indicated that while feature feedback aids interpretability, it offered minimal performance gains on in-domain evaluations. This paper examines whether feature feedback can enhance out-of-domain performance.

**Key Findings**:

1. **Sentiment Analysis**: In experiments involving sentiment analysis, models trained with feature feedback showed no significant improvement in in-domain accuracy compared to classify-only models. However, these models exhibited substantial performance gains on out-of-domain datasets. For instance, both ELECTRA and BERT models achieved approximately 6% higher accuracy on Amazon and Yelp reviews when trained with feature feedback, even when only 25% of the training instances included such feedback.
2. **Natural Language Inference (NLI)**: In contrast, for NLI tasks, incorporating feature feedback did not lead to significant improvements in either in-domain or out-of-domain performance. The study suggests that the high overlap of rationale tokens in NLI (approximately 80% of unique tokens) may reduce the distinctiveness of the feedback, limiting its effectiveness.
3. **Vocabulary Analysis**: The research found that in sentiment analysis, rationales comprised about 21% of unique tokens in the training set, indicating that specific words or phrases are more indicative of sentiment. This specificity likely contributes to the observed out-of-domain performance gains. In contrast, the broader distribution of rationale tokens in NLI may dilute their impact.

**Conclusion**:

The paper concludes that feature feedback can enhance model robustness to distribution shifts in tasks like sentiment analysis, where specific evidence spans are strongly associated with the target labels. However, in tasks like NLI, where the relationship between input features and labels is more complex, feature feedback does not provide the same benefits. These findings highlight the importance of task-specific characteristics in determining the effectiveness of feature feedback for improving model generalization under distribution shift.

### 16. Online Label Shift: Optimal Dynamic Regret meets Practical Algorithms

**TL;DR**: The paper "Online Label Shift: Optimal Dynamic Regret meets Practical Algorithms" addresses the challenge of adapting machine learning models to environments where the distribution of class labels changes over time—a scenario known as online label shift. The authors introduce novel algorithms that reduce this adaptation problem to online regression, achieving optimal dynamic regret without prior knowledge of the extent of label distribution drift. Their methods are applicable in both supervised and unsupervised settings and demonstrate superior performance across various simulated and real-world scenarios, often improving accuracy by 1-3% while maintaining sample and computational efficiency.

Pages: 42.

**Detailed Summary**:

In real-world applications, data distributions often evolve over time, posing significant challenges for machine learning models trained under the assumption of static distributions. This paper focuses on the online label shift scenario, where the marginal distribution of class labels changes over time, but the conditional distribution of features given labels remains constant. The authors address both unsupervised and supervised settings:

- **Unsupervised Online Label Shift (UOLS)**: The goal is to adapt a pre-trained classifier to changing label distributions using only unlabeled online data.
- **Supervised Online Label Shift (SOLS)**: The objective is to concurrently learn a classifier and adapt to dynamically evolving class marginals using labeled online data.

**Key Contributions**:

1. **Algorithmic Framework**: The authors develop algorithms that transform the adaptation problem into an online regression task. By leveraging online regression oracles, their methods can track drifting label proportions effectively. This approach circumvents the need for convexity assumptions typically required in online convex optimization, broadening the applicability to a wider range of classifiers, including non-linear models like decision trees.
2. **Optimal Dynamic Regret**: The proposed algorithms achieve optimal dynamic regret bounds without prior knowledge of the degree of label distribution drift. Dynamic regret measures the performance of an online algorithm against a sequence of best possible models in hindsight, making it a more suitable metric for non-stationary environments compared to static regret.
3. **Empirical Validation**: Experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform existing approaches in various online label shift scenarios. The algorithms consistently achieve 1-3% improvements in accuracy while being sample-efficient and computationally feasible.

**Practical Implications**:

The findings suggest that the proposed algorithms can be effectively applied in dynamic environments where label distributions are subject to change. This has practical significance for applications such as spam detection, medical diagnosis, and financial forecasting, where the prevalence of different classes can shift over time. 

In summary, this paper presents a significant advancement in online learning under label shift, offering practical algorithms with strong theoretical guarantees and empirical performance.

### 17. RLSbench: Domain Adaptation Under Relaxed Label Shift

**TL;DR**: The paper introduces RLSbench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating domain adaptation methods under relaxed label shift conditions across various data modalities. It reveals that many existing methods struggle with label proportion shifts and proposes a two-step meta-algorithm to enhance performance in such scenarios.

Pages: 50.

Domain adaptation aims to enable models trained on a source domain to perform well on a different target domain. Traditional methods often assume that the conditional distribution of features given labels remains constant between domains. However, in real-world applications, both the feature distributions and label proportions can shift, leading to challenges in model adaptation.

The authors identify that while some methods address label shifts, they are sensitive to changes in class-conditional distributions. Conversely, popular deep learning heuristics may falter when label proportions change. To address this, they introduce RLSbench, a large-scale benchmark comprising over 500 distribution shift pairs across vision, tabular, and language data, with varying label proportions. This benchmark emphasizes shifts in label marginals, providing a more realistic evaluation framework.

Through RLSbench, the study evaluates 13 domain adaptation methods, uncovering widespread failures under label proportion shifts that were previously unrecognized. To mitigate these issues, the authors propose a two-step meta-algorithm:

1. **Pseudo-balancing the data at each epoch**: This involves adjusting the training process to account for imbalances in label proportions, ensuring that the model does not become biased towards overrepresented classes.
2. **Adjusting the final classifier with target label distribution estimates**: By estimating the label distribution in the target domain, the classifier can be fine-tuned to better align with the target data, improving accuracy.

This meta-algorithm enhances existing domain adaptation heuristics under significant label proportion shifts, often improving accuracy by 2–10 percentage points, while having minimal effect when label proportions remain constant. The authors hope that RLSbench will encourage researchers to rigorously evaluate proposed methods in relaxed label shift settings. The code for RLSbench is publicly available, facilitating further research in this area.

### 18. Domain Adaptation under Open Set Label Shift

**TL;DR**: The paper introduces the problem of Domain Adaptation under Open Set Label Shift (OSLS), where the label distribution can change arbitrarily, and new classes may emerge during deployment, while class-conditional distributions remain invariant. The authors propose methods to estimate the target label distribution and learn a target classifier, demonstrating significant improvements over existing baselines.

Pages: 39.

In real-world applications, models often encounter scenarios where the distribution of labels changes over time, and entirely new classes appear that were not present during training. This presents challenges for traditional domain adaptation techniques, which may not effectively handle such shifts.

The authors introduce the concept of Open Set Label Shift (OSLS), which encompasses situations where:

- The label distribution between the source and target domains can change arbitrarily.
- New, previously unseen classes may emerge in the target domain.
- Class-conditional distributions (i.e., the distribution of features given a class) remain consistent across domains.

This framework generalizes existing problems like label shift and Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning.

The primary objectives in OSLS are:

1. **Estimating the target label distribution**, including the prevalence of any novel classes.
2. **Learning a classifier** that can accurately predict labels in the target domain, accounting for both existing and new classes.

The authors establish necessary and sufficient conditions for identifying these quantities and propose practical methods that leverage black-box predictors to achieve these goals. Unlike typical Open Set Domain Adaptation (OSDA) problems, which are often ill-posed and rely on heuristics, OSLS provides a well-defined problem that can be addressed with principled approaches.

Experiments conducted across various semi-synthetic benchmarks, including vision, language, and medical datasets, demonstrate that the proposed methods consistently outperform existing OSDA baselines, achieving improvements in target domain accuracy ranging from 10% to 25%. Additionally, the authors provide theoretical analysis, establishing finite-sample convergence to the true label marginal and convergence to the optimal classifier in specific settings.

### 19. Domain Adaptation under Missingness Shift

**TL;DR**: The paper introduces the problem of Domain Adaptation under Missingness Shift (DAMS), where distributional changes arise due to varying patterns of missing data between source and target domains. The authors provide theoretical insights and propose methods to adapt models effectively under such shifts, demonstrating their efficacy through experiments.

Pages: 32.

In real-world scenarios, the rate and pattern of missing data can vary across different times, locations, or systems, even when the underlying data distributions remain stable. Such variations, termed "missingness shift," pose challenges for machine learning models trained under one missingness pattern and deployed in another.

The authors formalize this challenge as the Domain Adaptation under Missingness Shift (DAMS) problem, where labeled source data and unlabeled target data differ due to distinct missing data mechanisms. They explore scenarios both with and without missing data indicators (i.e., flags indicating whether a data point is missing).

Key contributions of the paper include:

1. **Reduction to Covariate Shift with Indicators**: When missing data indicators are available, the DAMS problem can be reduced to a covariate shift scenario, allowing the use of existing adaptation techniques.
2. **Challenges without Indicators**: In the absence of missing data indicators, the situation becomes more complex. The authors establish that:
   - Covariate shift assumptions are violated, necessitating adaptation.
   - The optimal predictor trained on the source domain can perform significantly worse on the target domain compared to a naive predictor that always predicts the mean.
   - Despite the lack of identifiability of missingness rates, the optimal target predictor can still be determined.
   - For linear models, a straightforward analytical adjustment can provide consistent estimates of the optimal target parameters.
3. **Proposed Methods**: The paper introduces methods to adjust predictors trained on source data for effective performance on target data under missingness shift. These methods leverage observable relative proportions of nonzero values for each covariate across domains to make necessary adjustments.
4. **Empirical Validation**: Experiments on synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, showing improved performance when the underlying assumptions hold.

This work highlights the importance of considering missingness patterns in domain adaptation and provides a foundation for future research in this area.

### 20. Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models

**TL;DR**: The paper introduces "chain-of-thought prompting," a method that enhances large language models' reasoning abilities by generating intermediate reasoning steps. This approach significantly improves performance on complex tasks such as arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning, especially in models with approximately 100 billion parameters or more.

Pages: 43.

Traditional language models often struggle with tasks requiring multi-step reasoning, even as their size increases. To address this, the authors propose chain-of-thought prompting, where models are prompted with examples that include intermediate reasoning steps leading to the final answer. This method allows models to decompose complex problems into manageable steps, enhancing their problem-solving capabilities. 

Key findings include:

- **Enhanced Performance**: Chain-of-thought prompting leads to significant improvements across various reasoning tasks. For instance, a 540-billion parameter language model (PaLM 540B) achieved state-of-the-art accuracy on the GSM8K benchmark for math word problems, surpassing even fine-tuned models. 
- **Emergent Abilities in Large Models**: The reasoning capabilities facilitated by chain-of-thought prompting become prominent in models with around 100 billion parameters or more, indicating that model scale plays a crucial role in the emergence of complex reasoning skills. 
- **Broad Applicability**: This prompting technique is effective across a range of tasks, including arithmetic calculations, commonsense reasoning, and symbolic manipulation, demonstrating its versatility in enhancing language model performance. 

The authors' experiments involved various large language models and benchmarks, consistently showing that chain-of-thought prompting outperforms standard prompting methods. This approach does not require fine-tuning on large datasets, making it a practical and efficient method for improving reasoning in language models. 

### 21. Tree of Thoughts: Deliberate Problem Solving with Large Language Models

**TL;DR**: The paper introduces the "Tree of Thoughts" (ToT) framework, enhancing large language models' problem-solving abilities by enabling deliberate decision-making through exploration of multiple reasoning paths, self-evaluation, and strategic lookahead. This approach significantly improves performance on complex tasks requiring planning and search.

Pages: 14.

Traditional language models generate text in a token-level, left-to-right manner, which can limit their effectiveness in tasks that require complex reasoning, exploration, or strategic planning. To address these limitations, the authors propose the Tree of Thoughts framework, which generalizes the Chain of Thought approach by allowing models to explore multiple reasoning paths ("thoughts") as intermediate steps toward problem-solving. 

Key contributions of the paper include:

1. **Tree of Thoughts Framework**: ToT enables language models to perform deliberate decision-making by considering various reasoning paths, self-evaluating choices, and employing lookahead or backtracking strategies when necessary. 
2. **Enhanced Problem-Solving Abilities**: The framework significantly improves performance on tasks requiring non-trivial planning or search, such as the Game of 24, Creative Writing, and Mini Crosswords. For instance, in the Game of 24, GPT-4 with chain-of-thought prompting solved only 4% of tasks, whereas the ToT approach achieved a success rate of 74%. 
3. **Integration with Search Algorithms**: ToT combines language-based reasoning with search algorithms like breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS), facilitating systematic exploration of reasoning paths.

The authors' experiments demonstrate that ToT enhances language models' capabilities across various tasks by enabling more deliberate and strategic problem-solving approaches. This framework represents a significant advancement in the application of language models to complex reasoning tasks.

### 22. Active Learning under Label Shift

**TL;DR**: The paper introduces Mediated Active Learning under Label Shift (MALLS), a method that combines importance weighting and class-balanced sampling to address active learning challenges when class proportions differ between source and target domains. MALLS balances bias and variance, offering theoretical guarantees and demonstrating up to 60% reduction in sample complexity for deep active learning tasks.

Pages: 18.

In real-world applications, models often encounter scenarios where the class proportions differ between training (source) and deployment (target) environments, a situation known as label shift. Traditional active learning methods may struggle under such conditions, leading to inefficient or biased data collection.

The authors propose MALLS, which introduces a "medial distribution" to effectively combine:

- **Importance Weighting**: Adjusts for label shift with theoretical rigor but can suffer from high variance under significant shifts.
- **Class-Balanced Sampling (Subsampling)**: Addresses label shift practically but may lack strong theoretical guarantees and can be imprecise in active learning settings.

By balancing the bias from class-balanced sampling and the variance from importance weighting, MALLS provides a more robust approach to active learning under label shift.

Key contributions include:

1. **Theoretical Guarantees**: The authors provide sample complexity and generalization bounds for MALLS, demonstrating that active learning can reduce asymptotic sample complexity even under arbitrary label shift.
2. **Empirical Validation**: Experiments show that MALLS scales to high-dimensional datasets and can reduce the sample complexity of active learning by up to 60% in deep learning tasks.

This work offers a principled approach to active learning in the presence of label shift, combining the strengths of importance weighting and class-balanced sampling to improve data collection efficiency and model performance.

- Translating high-level ML models (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) into optimized lower-level code.
- Optimizing the model for specific hardware (e.g., CPUs, GPUs, TPUs).
- Reducing latency, memory usage, and inference costs.

They focus on deployment rather than training and ensure that models run efficiently on edge devices, mobile devices, or in cloud environments.

**Why Are ML Compilers Important?**

1. **Hardware Specialization:**
   Different hardware has unique architectures (e.g., GPUs are parallelized, TPUs are matrix-optimized). ML compilers optimize models to leverage these features.
2. **Performance Gains:**
   Proper optimization can significantly reduce inference time and resource consumption, improving user experience and reducing infrastructure costs.
3. **Growing Complexity of ML Models:**
   As ML models become more complex (e.g., large transformers), compilers are essential for making them feasible to deploy on constrained hardware.

**How Do ML Compilers Work?**

1. **High-Level Model Representation:**
   ML frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch define models using high-level abstractions.
2. **Lower-Level Intermediate Representation (IR):**
   ML compilers translate models into an intermediate representation (IR) that is hardware-agnostic. This IR acts as a bridge between the high-level model and low-level hardware instructions.
3. **Optimization Techniques:**
   - **Graph Optimizations:** Removing redundant computations, merging operations, or reordering them for efficiency.
   - **Operator Fusion:** Combining multiple operations into one to reduce overhead.
   - **Quantization:** Reducing precision (e.g., from 32-bit to 8-bit) to speed up computation while maintaining accuracy.
   - **Memory Management:** Optimizing data movement and storage to minimize memory bottlenecks.
4. **Hardware-Specific Code Generation:**
   The compiler tailors the optimized IR for specific hardware, generating highly efficient low-level code.

**Examples of ML Compilers and Optimizers:**

3. **Framework Fragmentation:**
   The variety of ML frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.) creates challenges for interoperability and standardization.

**Conclusion:**

Machine learning compilers and optimizers are essential tools for making ML models faster, more efficient, and deployable on a wide range of hardware. By automating the process of optimization, they reduce the need for manual tuning, enabling data scientists and engineers to focus on building better models. As hardware and ML models evolve, compilers will play a critical role in bridging the gap between research and production deployment.

### 28. Unsupervised Learning under Latent Label Shift

**TL;DR**: The paper introduces a novel approach to unsupervised learning by leveraging distribution shifts across multiple domains to identify latent classes, proposing the Latent Label Shift (LLS) framework and a practical algorithm that outperforms traditional methods, especially when feature-space similarity fails to reveal true groupings.

Pages: 33.

The paper  addresses the challenge of discovering latent classes in unlabeled data, particularly when traditional feature-space similarity methods are inadequate. The authors introduce the Latent Label Shift (LLS) framework, which assumes access to unlabeled data from multiple domains where label distributions can vary, but class-conditional distributions remain constant. This setup allows the identification of classes based on the principle that elements shifting together across domains likely belong to the same group.

In finite input spaces, the authors establish an isomorphism between LLS and topic modeling, drawing parallels between inputs and words, domains and documents, and labels and topics. For continuous data, they demonstrate that with oracle access to domain discriminators, it's possible to identify label distributions up to permutation.

Building on these theoretical insights, the paper proposes a practical algorithm that:

1. Utilizes domain-discriminative models to estimate the probability of a domain given an input.
2. Clusters examples based on these domain discriminator outputs.
3. Applies non-negative matrix factorization to the clustered data.
4. Combines the recovered label distributions with discriminator outputs to compute label probabilities for each domain.

Through semi-synthetic experiments, the authors demonstrate that their algorithm effectively leverages domain information, outperforming competitive unsupervised classification methods, particularly in scenarios where feature-space similarity does not reflect true groupings. This work establishes a significant connection between distribution shift and topic modeling, opening new avenues for future research in unsupervised learning.

### 30. Common pitfalls when building generative AI applications by Chip Huyen

Pages: 7.

Several frequent mistakes teams make when developing generative AI products:

1. **Using Generative AI Unnecessarily**: Teams often apply generative AI to problems that can be solved more efficiently with simpler methods. For instance, using linear programming for scheduling tasks may be more effective than deploying a generative AI model.
2. **Confusing 'Bad Product' with 'Bad AI'**: Negative user feedback is sometimes attributed to AI performance when the real issue lies in product design or user experience. Understanding user needs and integrating AI seamlessly into workflows is crucial.
3. **Starting Too Complex**: Beginning with intricate solutions can lead to unnecessary complications. It's advisable to start with simpler approaches and iterate based on user feedback and performance metrics.
4. **Overvaluing Early Success**: Initial positive results can create a false sense of accomplishment. Achieving incremental improvements becomes increasingly challenging, and teams should be prepared for diminishing returns as they refine their products.
5. **Neglecting Human Evaluation**: Relying solely on automated evaluations can be misleading. Incorporating human assessments helps ensure the AI's outputs are practical and aligned with user expectations.
6. **Crowdsourcing Use Cases Without Strategy**: Gathering ideas from a broad audience without a clear strategy can lead to low-impact applications. It's essential to focus on use cases that align with the organization's goals and offer significant value.

By being aware of these pitfalls, teams can navigate the complexities of building generative AI applications more effectively.

### 31. Self-serve feature platforms: architectures and APIs by Chip Huyen

Pages: 17.

**Evolution of Feature Platforms**

Feature platforms have become essential as companies transition from batch to online predictions. They manage feature engineering, computation, and serve computed features for models to generate predictions. A key challenge in online prediction is latency, which can be categorized into:

1. **Feature Computation Latency**: Time taken to compute features from raw data.
2. **Feature Retrieval Latency**: Time taken for the prediction service to retrieve computed features.
3. **Prediction Computation Latency**: Time taken for a model to generate a prediction from computed features.

While feature stores focus on storing and retrieving computed features to reduce retrieval latency and computation costs, feature platforms encompass both computation and retrieval processes. Notable examples include Airbnb's Chronon and LinkedIn's Feathr.

**Self-Serve Feature Engineering**

To accelerate the iteration speed for streaming features, it's crucial to develop feature platforms that are self-serve for data scientists. Challenges in this area include:

1. **Feature API**: Providing user-friendly APIs that allow data scientists to create, deploy, discover, and experiment with features without deep involvement from data engineers. This includes offering interfaces in familiar languages like Python, SQL, or Scala.

### 36. A Unified View of Label Shift Estimation

Pages: 21.

**TL;DR**: The paper "A Unified View of Label Shift Estimation" by Saurabh Garg et al. presents a comprehensive analysis of two primary methods for addressing label shift: Black Box Shift Estimation (BBSE) and Maximum Likelihood Label Shift (MLLS). The authors establish theoretical foundations for MLLS, demonstrating that its consistency relies on classifier calibration and an invertible confusion matrix. They also unify BBSE and MLLS within a common framework, revealing that BBSE corresponds to MLLS with a specific calibration approach. Empirical evaluations on synthetic data, MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets confirm MLLS's superior performance, attributed to its finer calibration granularity.

**Key Contributions:**

1. **Consistency Conditions for MLLS:**
   - **Calibration Requirement:** The study proves that for MLLS to yield consistent label shift estimates, the classifier must be well-calibrated. This ensures that the predicted probabilities accurately reflect true class probabilities.
   - **Invertible Confusion Matrix:** An invertible confusion matrix is essential, as it allows for the accurate mapping between predicted and actual class distributions.
2. **Unified Framework for BBSE and MLLS:**
   - **Calibration Perspective:** The authors demonstrate that BBSE can be viewed as a special case of MLLS when a particular calibration method is applied. This unification provides deeper insights into the relationship between the two approaches.
   - **Information Loss in BBSE:** The analysis indicates that BBSE's statistical inefficiency arises from information loss due to its coarse calibration strategy.
3. **Finite-Sample Error Analysis:**
   - **Error Decomposition:** The paper decomposes the finite-sample error of MLLS into components related to miscalibration and estimation errors. This breakdown aids in understanding the sources of inaccuracies in label shift estimation.
4. **Empirical Validation:**
   - **Dataset Experiments:** Experiments conducted on synthetic datasets, as well as MNIST and CIFAR-10, demonstrate that MLLS often achieves 2–10 times lower mean squared error in label shift estimation compared to BBSE.
   - **Calibration Granularity Impact:** The superior performance of MLLS is linked to its ability to utilize finer-grained calibration, reducing information loss and enhancing estimation accuracy.
