# Design Patterns

### Abstract Factory

Provides an interface to create families of related objects.

### Builder

Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing step-by-step assembly.

### Prototype

Creates new objects by copying an existing one, reducing overhead.

### Singleton

Ensures a single instance of a class, providing global access. The Singleton pattern helps maintain a single point of control for specific resources, configurations, or tasks in a program, ensuring that there's just one instance to avoid conflicts and provide easy access to that instance from anywhere in the program.

### Adapter

Allows incompatible interfaces to work together by providing a wrapper.

### Bridge

Separates an abstraction from its implementation, allowing both to evolve independently.

### Composite

Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.

### Decorator

Dynamically adds responsibilities to objects without altering their structure.

### Facade

Provides a simplified interface to a set of interfaces to make them easier to use.

### Flyweight

Minimizes memory usage or computational expenses by sharing as much as possible with related objects.

### Proxy

Acts as an intermediary, controlling access to another object, allowing for additional behavior or security checks.

### Chain of Responsibility

Passes a request along a chain of handlers, allowing each handler to decide whether to process or pass the request.

### Request Relay

Routes requests through a network of interconnected nodes for processing.

### Command

Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing parameterization and queuing of requests.

### Iterator

Provides a way to access elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying structure.

### Mediator

Centralizes communication among objects, reducing direct connections and promoting flexibility.

### Memento

Captures and externalizes an object's internal state, allowing it to be restored to a previous state.

### Observer

Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, ensuring that when one object changes state, its dependents are notified and updated.

### Visitor

Represents an operation to be performed on elements of an object structure, allowing new operations without changing the elements.
