## Episode highlight

Sundar Pichai: 00:00:00: It was a five-year waiting list, and  we got a rotary telephone. But it dramatically changed our lives. People would come to our house to make calls to their loved ones. I would have to go all the way to the hospital to get blood test records and it  would take two hours to go and they would say, “Sorry, it’s not ready.  Come back the next day.”, two hours to come back. And that became a  five-minute thing. So as a kid, this light bulb went in my head, this  power of technology to change people’s lives.        

00:00:32: We had no running water. It was a  massive drought, so they would get water in these trucks, maybe eight  buckets per household. So me and my brother, sometimes my mom, we would  wait in line, get that and bring it back home. Many years later, we had  running water and we had a water heater, and you could get hot water to  take a shower. For me, everything was discreet like that.        

00:01:02: So, I’ve always had this thing,  first-hand feeling of how technology can dramatically change your life,  and the opportunity it brings. I think if p(doom) is actually high, at  some point, all of humanity is aligned in making sure that’s not the  case, and so we’ll actually make more progress against it, I think. So  the irony is there is a self-modulating aspect there. I think if  humanity collectively puts their mind to solving a problem, whatever it  is, I think we can get there.        

00:01:38: Because of that, I think I’m  optimistic on the p(doom) scenarios, but that doesn’t mean I think the  underlying risk is actually pretty high. But I have a lot of faith in  humanity rising up to meet that moment.        

Lex Fridman: 00:01:55: Take me through that experience, when  there’s all these articles saying, ” You’re the wrong guy to lead Google through this. Google’s lost. It’s done. It’s over.”        

## Introduction

Lex Fridman: 00:02:08: The following is a conversation with Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google and Alphabet on this, the Lex Fridman podcast.        

## Growing up in India

Lex Fridman: 00:02:18: Your life story is inspiring to a lot  of people. It’s inspiring to me. You grew up in India, whole family  living in a humble two-room apartment, very little, almost no access to  technology. And from those humble beginnings, you rose to lead a $2  trillion technology company.        

00:02:41: If you could travel back in time and  told that, let’s say, twelve-year-old Sundar that you’re now leading one of the largest companies in human history, what do you think that young kid would say?        

Sundar Pichai: 00:02:51: I would’ve probably laughed it off. Probably too far-fetched to imagine or believe at that time.        

Lex Fridman: 00:03:00: You would have to explain the internet first.        

Sundar Pichai: 00:03:02: For sure. Computers to me, at that  time, I was 12 in 1984, so probably… By then, I’d started reading about  them, but I hadn’t seen one.        

Lex Fridman: 00:03:16: What was that place like? Take me to your childhood.        

Sundar Pichai: 00:03:19: I grew up in Chennai. It’s in south of India. It’s a beautiful, bustling city, lots of people, lots of energy, simple life. Definitely fond memories of playing cricket outside the  home. We just used to play on the streets. All the neighborhood kids  would come out and we would play until it got dark and we couldn’t play  anymore, barefoot. Traffic would come. We would just stop the game.  Everything would drive through and you would just continue playing, just to get the visual in your head.        

00:03:51: Pre computers, there a lot of free  time, now that I think about it. Now you have to go and seek that quiet  solitude or something. Newspapers, books is how I gained access to the  world’s information at the time [inaudible 00:04:06].        

00:04:07: My grandfather was a big influence. He worked in the post office. He was so good with language. His English…  His handwriting, till today, is the most beautiful handwriting I’ve ever seen. He would write so clearly. He was so articulate, and so he got me introduced into books. He loved politics. We could talk about anything.        

00:04:33: That was there in my family  throughout. Lots of books, trashy books, good books, everything from Ayn Rand to books on philosophy to stupid crime novels. Books was a big  part of my life, but the soul, it’s not surprising I ended up at Google, because Google’s mission always resonated deeply with me. This access  to knowledge, I was hungry for it.        

00:04:58: But definitely have fond memories of  my childhood. Access to knowledge was there, so that’s the wealth we  had. Every aspect of technology I had to wait for a while. I’ve  obviously spoken before about how long it took for us to get a phone,  about five years, but it’s not the only thing.        

Lex Fridman: 00:05:15: A telephone?        

Sundar Pichai: 00:05:16: There was a five-year waiting list,  and we got a rotary telephone. But it dramatically changed our lives.  People would come to our house to make calls to their loved ones. I  would have to go all the way to the hospital to get blood test records,  and it would take two hours to go and they would say, “Sorry, it’s not  ready. Come back the next day.”, two hours to come back. And that became a five-minute thing. So as a kid, this light bulb went in my head, this power of technology to change people’s lives.        

00:05:48: We had no running water. It was a  massive drought, so they would get water in these trucks, maybe eight  buckets per household. So me and my brother, sometimes my mom, we would  wait in line, get that and bring it back home. Many years later, we had  running water and we had a water heater, and you could get hot water to  take a shower. For me, everything was discreet like that. So, I’ve  always had this thing, first-hand feeling of how technology can  dramatically change your life, and the opportunity it brings. That was a subliminal takeaway for me throughout growing up. I actually observed  it and felt it.        

00:06:41: We had to convince my dad for a long time to get a VCR. Do you know what a VCR is?        

Lex Fridman: 00:06:48: Yes.        

Sundar Pichai: 00:06:49: I’m trying to date you now. Because  before that, you only had one TV channel. That’s it. So, you can watch  movies or something like that, but this was by the time I was in 12th  grade, we got a VCR. It was a Panasonic, which we had to go to some shop which had smuggled it in, I guess, and that’s where we bought a VCR.  But then being able to record a World Cup football game or get bootleg  videotapes and watch movies, all that.        

00:07:26: So I had these discrete memories  growing up, and so always left me with the feeling of how getting access to technology drives that step change in your life.        

Lex Fridman: 00:07:38: I don’t think you’ll ever be able to equal the first time you get hot water.        

Sundar Pichai: 00:07:42: To have that convenience of going and opening a tap and have hot water come out? Yeah.        

Lex Fridman: 00:07:47: It’s interesting. We take for granted  the progress we’ve made. If you look at human history, just those plots  that look at GDP across 2,000 years, and you see that exponential growth to where most of the progress happened since the Industrial Revolution, and we just take for granted, we forget how far we’ve gone. So, our  ability to understand how great we have it and also how quickly  technology can improve is quite poor.        

Sundar Pichai: 00:08:17: Oh. I mean, it’s extraordinary. I go  back to India now, the power of mobile. It’s mind blowing to see the  progress through the arc of time. It’s phenomenal.        

## Advice for young people

Lex Fridman: 00:08:27: What advice would you give to young  folks listening to this all over the world, who look up to you and find  your story inspiring, who want to be maybe the next Sundar Pichai, who  want to start, create companies, build something that has a lot of  impact in the world?        

Sundar Pichai: 00:08:45: You have a lot of luck along the way,  but you obviously have to make smart choices, you’re thinking about what you want to do, your brain is telling you something. But when you do  things, I think it’s important to get that… Listen to your heart and see whether you actually enjoy doing it. That feeling of if you love what  you do, it’s so much easier, and you’re going to see the best version of yourself. It’s easier said than done. I think it’s tough to find things you love doing. But I think listening to your heart a bit more than  your mind in terms of figuring out what you want to do, I think is one  of the best things I would tell people.        

00:09:26: The second thing is trying to work  with people who you feel… At various points in my life I’ve worked with  people who I felt were better than me. You almost are sitting in a room  talking to someone and they’re wow. you want that feeling a few times.  Trying to get yourself in a position where you’re working with people  who you feel are stretching your abilities is what helps you grow, I  think, so putting yourself in uncomfortable situations. And I think  often you’ll surprise yourself.        

00:10:01: So, I think being open minded enough to put yourself in those positions is maybe another thing I would say.        

## Styles of leadership

Lex Fridman: 00:10:09: What lessons can we learn? Maybe from  an outsider perspective, for me, looking at your story and gotten to  know you a bit, you’re humble, you’re kind. Usually when I think of  somebody who has had a journey like yours and climbs to the very top of  leadership in a cutthroat world, they’re usually going to be a bit of an asshole. What wisdom are we supposed to draw from the fact that your  general approach is of balance, of humility, of kindness, listening to  everybody. What’s your secret?        

Sundar Pichai: 00:10:41: I do get angry. I do get frustrated. I have the same emotions all of us do in the context of work and  everything. But a few things: I think I… Over time I figured out the  best way to get the most out of people. You find mission-oriented people who are in the shared journey, who have this inner drive to excellence  to do the best. You motivate people and you can achieve a lot that way.  It often tends to work out that way.        

00:11:19: But have there been times I lose it?  Yeah. Maybe less often than others, and maybe over the years less and  less so, because I find it’s not needed to achieve what you need to do.        

Lex Fridman: 00:11:35: So, losing your shit has not been productive?        

Sundar Pichai: 00:11:38: Less often than not. I think people respond to that.        

Lex Fridman: 00:11:40: Yeah.        

Sundar Pichai: 00:11:41: They may do stuff to react to that.  You actually want them to do the right thing. I’m a sports fan. In  soccer, not football, people often talk about man management. Great  coaches do. I think there is an element of that in our lives. How do you get the best out of the people you work with?        

00:12:08: At times, you’re working with people  who are so committed to achieving, if they’ve done something wrong, they feel it more than you do, so you treat them differently than…  Occasionally, there are people who you need to clearly let them know  that wasn’t okay or whatever it is. But I’ve often found that not to be  the case.        

Lex Fridman: 00:12:28: And sometimes the right words at the right time spoken firmly can reverberate through time.        

Sundar Pichai: 00:12:35: Also sometimes, the unspoken words.  People can sometimes see that you’re unhappy without you saying it, and  so sometimes the silence can deliver that message even more.        

Lex Fridman: 00:12:48: Sometimes less is more.        

00:12:50: Who’s the greatest soccer player of all time? Messi, Ronaldo or Pelé or Maradona?        

Sundar Pichai: 00:12:55: I’m going to make… In this question…        

Lex Fridman: 00:12:58: Is this going to be a political answer, Sundar?        

Sundar Pichai: 00:12:58: I’m not going to lie. I will tell the truthful answer, the truthful answer.        

Lex Fridman: 00:13:03: So it’s Messi, okay.        

Sundar Pichai: 00:13:05: It is. It’s been interesting. Because  my son is a big Cristiano Ronaldo fan, and so we’ve had to watch El  Clasicos together with that dynamic in there. I so admire CR7s. I mean,  I’ve never seen an athlete more committed to that kind of excellence,  and so he’s one of the all-time greats. But for me, Messi is it.        

Lex Fridman: 00:13:31: When I see Lionel Messi, you just are  in awe that humans are able to achieve that level of greatness and  genius and artistry. We’ll talk about AI, maybe robotics and this kind  of stuff, that level of genius, I’m not sure you can possibly match by  AI in a long time. It’s just an example of greatness. And you have that  kind of greatness in other disciplines, but in sport, you get to  visually see it, unlike anything else. Just the timing, the movement,  there’s just genius.        

Sundar Pichai: 00:14:03: Had the chance to see him a couple of  weeks ago. He played in San Jose against the Quakes, so I went to see  the game. I had good seats, knew where he would play in the second half  hopefully. And even at his age, just watching him when he gets the ball, that movement… You’re right, that special quality. It’s tough to  describe, but you feel it when you see it, yeah.        

## Impact of AI in human history

Lex Fridman: 00:14:27: He’s still got it. If we rank all the  technological innovations throughout human history… Let’s go back maybe  the history of human civilizations, 12,000 years ago, and you rank them  by how much of a productivity multiplier they’ve been. We can go to  electricity or the labor mechanization of the Industrial Revolution, or  we can go back to the first Agricultural Revolution 12,000 years ago. In that long list of inventions, do you think AI… When history is written  1,000 years from now, do you think it has a chance to be the number one  productivity multiplier?        

Sundar Pichai: 00:15:08: It’s a great question. Many years ago, I think it might’ve been 2017 or 2018, I said at the time, AI is the  most profound technology humanity will ever work on. It’ll be more  profound than fire or electricity. So, I have to back myself. I still  think that’s the case.        

00:15:27: When you ask this question, I was  thinking, do we have a recency bias? In sports, it’s very tempting to  call the current person you’re seeing the greatest…        

Lex Fridman: 00:15:35: Yes.        

Sundar Pichai: 00:15:36: … player. Is there a recency bias? I  do think, from first principles I would argue, AI will be bigger than  all of those. I didn’t live through those moments. Two years ago, I had  to go through a surgery, and then I processed that. There was a point in time people didn’t have anesthesia when they went through these  procedures. At that moment, I was like, that has got to be the greatest  invention humanity has ever, ever done. We don’t know what it is to have lived through those times.        

00:16:12: Many of what you’re talking about were this general things, which pretty much affected everything: electricity or internet, et cetera. But I don’t think we’ve ever dealt with the  technology both which is progressing so fast, becoming so capable it’s  not clear what the ceiling is, and the main, unique…. It’s recursively  self-improving, it’s capable of that.        

00:16:41: The fact it is the first technology  will dramatically accelerate creation itself, like creating things,  building new things, can improve and achieve things on its own, I think  puts it in a different. So, I think the impact it’ll end up having will  far surpass everything we’ve seen before. Obviously, with that comes a  lot of important things to think and wrestle with, but I definitely  think that’ll end up being the case.        

Lex Fridman: 00:17:15: Especially if it gets to the point of  where we can achieve superhuman performance on the AI research itself.  So, it’s a technology that may… It’s an open question, but it may be  able to achieve a level to where the technology itself can create itself better than it could yesterday.        

Sundar Pichai: 00:17:33: It’s like the move 37 of Alpha research or whatever it is.        

Lex Fridman: 00:17:38: Yeah.        

Sundar Pichai: 00:17:39: You’re right, when it can do novel,  self-directed research. Obviously, for a long time we’ll have hopefully  always humans in the loop and all that stuff. These are complex  questions to talk about. But yes, I think the underlying technology…  I’ve said this, if you watched seeing AlphaGo start from scratch, be  clueless, and become better through the course of a day, really, it hits you when you see that happen.        

00:18:13: Even the Veo 3 models, if you sample  the models when they were 30% done and 60% done, and looked at what they were generating, and you see how it all comes together, I would say  it’s inspiring, a little bit unsettling, as a human. So all of that is  true, I think.        

Lex Fridman: 00:18:36: The interesting thing of the  Industrial Revolution, electricity, like you mentioned. You can go back  to, again, the first Agricultural Revolution, there’s what’s called the  Neolithic package of the first Agricultural Revolution. It wasn’t just  that the nomads settled down and started planting food, but all this  other kinds of technology was born from that, and it’s included this  package. So, it wasn’t one piece of technology.        

00:19:05: There’s these ripple effects, second-  and third-order effects that happen, everything from something profound  like pottery, it can store liquids and food, to something we take for  granted: social hierarchies and political hierarchies. Early government  was formed. Because it turns out if humans stop moving and have some  surplus food, they get bored and they start coming up with interesting  systems. And then trade emerges, which turns out to be a really profound thing, and like I said, government. Second- and third-order effects  from that, including that package, is incredible and probably extremely  difficult. If you ask one of the people in the nomadic tribes to predict that, it would be impossible, and it’s difficult to predict.        

00:19:56: But all that said, what do you think are some of the early things we might see in the, quote, unquote, “AI package”?        

Sundar Pichai: 00:20:07: Most of it probably we don’t know  today, but the one thing which we can tangibly start seeing now is…  Obviously with the coding progress, you got a sense of it. It’s going to be so easy to imagine… Thoughts in your head, translating that into  things that exist. That’ll be part of the package. It’s going to empower almost all of humanity to express themselves.        

00:20:34: Maybe in the past you could have  expressed with words, but you could build things into existence. Maybe  not fully today, we are at the early stages of vibe coding. I’ve been  amazed at what people have put out online with Veo 3. But it takes a bit of work, you have to stitch together a set of prompts. But all this is  going to get better. The thing I always think: this is the worst it’ll  ever be, at any given moment in time.        

Lex Fridman: 00:21:02: It’s interesting you went there as a first thought: an exponential increase of access to creativity.        

Sundar Pichai: 00:21:11: Software, creation… Are you creating a program, a piece of content to be shared with others, games down the  line? All of that just becomes infinitely more possible.        

Lex Fridman: 00:21:25: I think the big thing is that it makes it accessible. It unlocks the cognitive capabilities of the entire 8 billion.        

Sundar Pichai: 00:21:33: I agree. Think about 40 years ago, maybe in the US there were five people who could do what you were doing.        

Lex Fridman: 00:21:40: Mm-hmm.        

Sundar Pichai: 00:21:41: Go do a interview… But today, think  about, with YouTube and other products, et cetera, how many more people  are doing it. I think this is what technology does. When the internet  created blogs, you heard from so many more people. But with AI, I think  that number won’t be in the few hundreds of thousands. It’ll be tens of  millions of people, maybe even a billion people putting out things into  the world in a deeper way.        

Lex Fridman: 00:22:17: And I think it’ll change the landscape of creativity. And it makes a lot of people nervous. For example,  whatever, Fox, MSNBC, CNN are really nervous about this podcast. You  mean this dude in a suit could just do this? And YouTube and thousands  of others, tens of thousands, millions of other creators can do the same kind of thing? That makes them nervous. And now you get a podcast from  Notebook LM that’s about five to 10 times better than any podcast I’ve  ever done.        

Sundar Pichai: 00:22:17: Not true, but yeah.        

Lex Fridman: 00:22:47: I’m joking at this time, but maybe  not. And that changes. You have to evolve. On the podcasting front, I’m a fan of podcasts much more than I am a fan of being a host or whatever.  If there’s great podcasts that are both AIs, I’ll just stop doing this  podcast. I’ll listen to that podcast. But you have to evolve and you  have to change, and that makes people really nervous, I think. But it’s  also really exciting future.        

Sundar Pichai: 00:23:11: The one thing I may say is, I do think in a world in which there are two AI, I think people value and choose…  Just like in chess, you and I would never watch Stockfish 10 or whatever and AlphaGo play against each… It would be boring for us to watch. But  Magnus Carlsen and Gukesh, that game would be much more fascinating to  watch. So, it’s tough to say.        

00:23:36: One way to say is you’ll have a lot  more content, and so you will be listening to AI-generated content  because sometimes it’s efficient, et cetera. But the premium experiences you value might be a version of the human essence wherever it comes  through. Going back to what we talked earlier about watching Messi  dribble the ball, I don’t know, one day I’m sure a machine will dribble  much better than Messi. But I don’t know whether it would evoke that  same emotion in us, so I think that’ll be fascinating to see.        

Lex Fridman: 00:24:05: I think the element of podcasting or  audio books that is about information gathering, that part might be  removed, or that might be more efficiently and in a compelling way done  by AI. But then it’ll be just nice to hear humans struggle with the  information, contend with the information, try to internalize it,  combine it with the complexity of our own emotions and consciousness and all that kind of stuff. But if you actually want to find out about a  piece of history, you go to Gemini. If you want to see Lex struggle with that history, or other humans, you look at that.        

00:24:47: The point is, it’s going to continue  to change the nature of how we discover information, how we consume the  information, how we create that information, the same way that YouTube  changed everything completely. It changed the news. And that’s something our society’s struggling with.        

Sundar Pichai: 00:25:04: YouTube enabled… You know this better  than anyone else. It’s enabled so many creators. There is no doubt in me that we will enable more filmmakers than have ever been. You’re going  to empower a lot more people. So I think there is an expansionary aspect of this, which is underestimated, I think. I think it’ll unleash human  creativity in a way that hasn’t been seen before. It’s tough to  internalize. The only way is if you brought someone from the ’50s or  ’40s and just put them in front of YouTube, I think it would blow their  mind away. Similarly, I think we would get blown away by what’s possible in a 10- to 20-year timeframe.        

Lex Fridman: 00:25:45: Do you think there’s a future? How  many years out is it that, let’s say… Let’s put a marker on it… 50% of  good content is generated by Veo 4, 5, 6?        

Sundar Pichai: 00:25:59: I think it depends on what it is for.  Maybe if you look at movies today with CGI, there are great filmmakers.  You still look at who the directors are and who use it. There are  filmmakers who don’t use it at all. You value that. There are people who use it incredibly. Think about somebody like a James Cameron, like what he would do with these tools in his hands.        

00:26:24: But I think there’ll be a lot more  content created. Just like writers today use Google Docs and not think  about the fact that they’re using a tool like that, people will be using the future versions of these things. It won’t be a big deal at all to  them.        

## Veo 3 and future of video

Lex Fridman: 00:26:40: I’ve gotten a chance to get to know  Darren Aronofsky. He’s been really leaning in and trying to figure out…  It’s fun to watch a genius who came up before any of this was even  remotely possible. He created Pi, one of my favorite movies. And from  there, he just continued to create a really interesting variety of  movies. And now he’s trying to see how can AI be used to create  compelling films. You have people like that.        

00:27:07: You have people I’ve gotten just to  know, edgier folks, they are AI firsts, like Dor Brothers. Both  Aronofsky and Dor Brothers create at the edge of the Overton window  society. They push, whether it’s sexuality or violence. It’s edgy, like  artists are, but it’s still classy. It doesn’t cross that line. Whatever that line is. Hunter S. Thompson has this line, “The only way to find  out where the edge, where the line is, is by crossing it.” And I think  for artists, that’s true. That’s their purpose sometimes. Comedians and  artists just cross that line.        

00:27:49: I wonder if you can comment on the  weird place that it puts Google. Because Google’s line is probably  different than some of these artists. How do you think about,  specifically Veo and Flow, how to allow artists to do crazy shit, but  also the responsibility for it not to be too crazy?        

Sundar Pichai: 00:28:15: It’s a great question. You mentioned  Darren. He’s a clear visionary. Part of the reason we started working  with him early on Veo is, he’s one of those people who’s able to see  that future, get inspired by it, and showing the way for how creative  people can express themselves with it. I think when it comes to allowing artistic free expression… It’s one of the most important values in a  society, I think. Artists have always been the ones to push boundaries,  expand the frontiers of thought.        

00:28:56: I think that’s going to be an  important value we have, so I think we will provide tools and put it in  the hands of artists for them to use and put out their work. Those APIs, I almost think of that as infrastructure. Just like when you provide  electricity to people or something, you want them to use it, and you’re  not thinking about the use cases on top of it.        

Lex Fridman: 00:29:20: It’s a paintbrush.        

Sundar Pichai: 00:29:20: Yeah. So, I think that’s how.  Obviously, there have to be some things. And society needs to decide at a fundamental level what’s okay, what’s not, will be responsible with it. But I do think when it comes to artistic free expression, I think  that’s one of those values we should work hard to defend.        

Lex Fridman: 00:29:44: I wonder if you can comment on maybe  earlier versions of Gemini were a little bit careful on the kind of  things it’d be willing to answer. I just want to comment on I was really surprised, and pleasantly surprised, and enjoy the fact that Gemini 2.5 Pro is a lot less careful, in a good sense. Don’t ask me why, but I’ve  been doing a lot of research on Genghis Khan and the Aztecs, so there’s a lot of violence there in that history. It’s a very violent history.  I’ve also been doing a lot of research on World War I and World War II.        

00:30:19: Earlier versions of Gemini were very…  Basically this sense, are you sure you want to learn about this. And  now, it’s actually very factual, objective, talks about very difficult  parts of human history, and does so with nuance and depth. It’s been  really nice. But there’s a line there that I guess Google has to walk.  And it’s also an engineering challenge how to do that at scale across  all the weird queries that people ask.        

00:30:49: Can you just speak to that challenge?  How do you allow Gemini to say… Again, forgive, pardon my French… crazy  shit, but not too crazy?        

Sundar Pichai: 00:31:00: I think one of the good insights here  has been as the models are getting more capable, the models are really  good at this stuff. And so I think in some ways, maybe a year ago, the  models weren’t fully there, so they would also do stupid things more  often. So you’re trying to handle those edge cases, but then you make a  mistake in how you handle those edge cases and it compounds. But I think with 2.5, what we particularly found is once the models cross a certain level of intelligence and sophistication, they are able to reason  through these nuanced issues pretty well.        

00:31:37: And I think users really want that.  You want as much access to the raw model as possible. I think it’s a  great area to think about. Over time, we should allow more and more  closer access to it. Obviously, let people custom prompts if they wanted to and experiment with it, et cetera. I think that’s an important  direction.        

00:32:04: The first principles we want to think  about it is, from a scientific standpoint, making sure the models… And  I’m saying scientific in the sense of how you would approach math or  physics or something like that. From first principles, having the models reason about the world, be nuanced, et cetera, from the ground up is  the right way to build these things, not some subset of humans  hard-coding things on top of it. I think it’s the direction we’ve been  taking and I think you’ll see us continue to push in that direction.        

Lex Fridman: 00:32:43: I took extensive notes and I gave them to Gemini and said, “Can you ask a novel question that’s not in these  notes?”, and it wrote… Gemini continues to really surprise me, really  surprise me. It’s been really beautiful. It’s an incredible model. The  question it generated was, “You…”, meaning Sundar, “… told the world  Gemini is churning out 480 trillion tokens a month. What’s the most  life-changing, five-word sentence hiding in that haystack?”. That’s a  Gemini question.        

00:33:17: I don’t think you can answer that, but it woke me up to all of these tokens are providing little aha moments  for people across the globe. So, that’s like learning. Those tokens are  people are curious, they ask a question and they find something out, and it truly could be life-changing.        

Sundar Pichai: 00:33:37: Oh, it is. I had the same feeling  about Search many, many years ago. These tokens per month has grown 50  times in the last 12 months.        

Lex Fridman: 00:33:49: Is that accurate, by the way? The 4…        

Sundar Pichai: 00:33:49: Yeah, it is. It is. It is accurate.  I’m glad it got it right. But that number was 9.7 trillion tokens per  month, 12 months ago. It’s gone up to 480. It’s a 50x…        

Sundar Pichai: 00:34:00: … right, it’s gone up to 480, it’s a  50 X increase. So there’s no limit to human curiosity. And I think it’s  one of those moments, I don’t think it is there today, but maybe one day there’s a five word phrase which says what the actual universe is or  something like that and something very meaningful, but I don’t think we  are quite there yet.        

## Scaling laws

Lex Fridman: 00:34:25: Do you think the scaling laws are  holding strong on, there’s a lot of ways to describe the scaling laws  for AI, but on the pre-training, on post-training fronts, so the flip  side of that, do you anticipate AI progress will hit a wall? Is there a  wall?        

Sundar Pichai: 00:34:42: It’s a cherished micro kitchen  conversation, once in a while I have it, like when Demis is visiting or  if Demis, Koray, Jeff, Norm, Sergey, a bunch of our people, we sit and  talk about this. Look, we see a lot of headroom ahead, I think. We’ve  been able to optimize and improve on all fronts, pre-training,  post-training, test time compute, tool use, over time, making these more agentic. So getting these models to be more general world models in  that direction.        

00:35:22: Like Veo 3, the physics understanding  is dramatically better than what Veo 1 or something like that was. So  you kind of see on all those dimensions, I feel progress is very obvious to see and I feel like there is significant headroom. More importantly, I’m fortunate to work with some of the best researchers on the planet,  they think there is more headroom to be had here. And so I think we have an exciting trajectory ahead. It’s tougher to say… Each year I sit and  say, okay, we are going to throw 10 X more compute over the course of  next year at it and will we see progress? Sitting here today, I feel  like the year ahead will have a lot of progress.        

Lex Fridman: 00:36:11: And do you feel any limitations like  the bottlenecks, compute limited, data limited, idea limited, do you  feel any of those limitations or is it full steam ahead on all fronts?        

Sundar Pichai: 00:36:24: I think it’s compute limited in this  sense, part of the reason you’ve seen us do Flash, Nano Flash and Pro  models, but not an Ultra model, it’s like for each generation we feel  like we’ve been able to get the Pro model at, I don’t know, 80, 90% of  Ultra’s capability, but Ultra would be a lot more slow and lot more  expensive to serve. But what we’ve been able to do is to go to the next  generation and make the next generation’s Pro as good as the previous  generation’s Ultra, but be able to serve it in a way that it’s fast and  you can use it and so on. So I do think scaling laws are working, but  it’s tough to get, at any given time, the models we all use the most,  this maybe a few months behind the maximum capability we can deliver  because that won’t be the fastest, easiest to use, et cetera.        

Lex Fridman: 00:37:26: Also, that’s in terms of intelligence, it becomes harder and harder to measure ” performance” because you  could argue Gemini Flash is much more impactful than Pro just because of the latency, it’s super intelligent already. I mean sometimes latency  is maybe more important than intelligence, especially when the  intelligence is just a little bit less and Flash not, it’s still  incredibly smart model. And so you have to now start measuring impact  and then it feels like benchmarks are less and less capable of capturing the intelligence of models, the effectiveness of models, the  usefulness, the real world usefulness, of models.        

## AGI and ASI

00:38:07: Another kitchen question. So lots of  folks are talking about timelines for AGI or ASI, artificial super  intelligence. So AGI loosely defined is basically human expert level at a lot of the main fields of pursuit for humans. And then ASI is what AGI  becomes, presumably quickly, by being able to self-improve. So becoming  far superior in intelligence across all these disciplines than humans.  When do you think we’ll have AGI? It’s 2030 a possibility?        

Sundar Pichai: 00:38:41: There’s one other term we should throw in there. I don’t know who used it first, maybe Karpathy did, AJI. Have you heard AJI, the artificial jagged intelligence? Sometimes feels that way, both their progress and you see what they can do and then you can  trivially find they make numerical errors or counting R’s in strawberry  or something, which seems to trip up most models or whatever it is. So  maybe we should throw that term in there. I feel like we are in the AJI  phase where dramatic progress, some things don’t work well, but overall  you’re seeing lots of progress.        

00:39:19: But if your question is will it happen by 2030? Look, we constantly move the line of what it means to be AGI.  There are moments today like sitting in a Waymo in a San Francisco  street with all the crowds and the people and work its way through, I  see glimpses of it there. The car is sometimes impatient, trying to work its way using Astra like in Gemini Live or asking questions about the  world.        

Speaker 1: 00:39:49: What’s a skinny building doing in my neighborhood?        

Speaker 2: 00:39:51: It’s a street light, not a building.        

Sundar Pichai: 00:39:54: You see glimpses, that’s why use the  word AJI because then you see stuff which obviously we are far from AGI  too, so you have both experiences simultaneously happening to you. I’ll  answer your question, but I’ll also throw out this. I almost feel the  term doesn’t matter, what I know is by 2030 there’ll be such dramatic  progress. We’ll be dealing with the consequences of that progress, both  the positive externalities and the negative externalities that come with it in a big way by 2030. So that I strongly feel.        

00:40:31: Whatever, we may be arguing about the  term or maybe Gemini can answer what that moment is in time in 2030, but I think the progress will be dramatic. So that I believe in. Will the  AI think it has reached AGI by 2030? I would say we will just fall short of that timeline, so I think it’ll take a bit longer. It’s amazing, in  the early days of Google DeepMind in 2010, they talked about a 20-year  timeframe to achieve AGI, which is kind of fascinating to see, but for  me, the whole thing, seeing what Google Brain did in 2012, and when we  acquired DeepMind in 2014, right close to where we are sitting, in 2012, Jeff Dean showed the image of when the neural networks could recognize a picture of a cat and identify it. This is the early versions of Brain.        

00:41:24: And so we all talked about couple  decades. I don’t think we’ll quite get there by 2030, so my sense is  it’s slightly after that, but I would stress it doesn’t matter what that definition is because you will have mind-blowing progress on many  dimensions. Maybe AI can create videos. We have to figure out as a  society, we need some system by which we all agree that this is  AI-generated and we have to disclose it in a certain way because how do  you distinguish reality otherwise?        

Lex Fridman: 00:41:58: Yeah, there’s so many interesting  things you said. So first of all, just looking back at this recent, now  feels like distant, history with Google Brain, I mean that was before  TensorFlow, before TensorFlow was made public, and open-sourced. So the  tooling matters too. Combined with GitHub, ability to share code. Then  you have the ideas of a potential transformers and the diffusion now and then there might be a new idea that seems simple in retrospect but will change everything, and that could be the post-training, the inference  time innovations.        

00:42:28: And I think shadcn Tweeted that Google is just one great UI from completely winning the AI race, meaning UI is a huge part of it. How that intelligence, I think the [inaudible  00:42:45] Project likes to talk about this right now, it’s an LLM, but  when is it going to become a system where you’re talking about shipping  systems versus shipping a particular model? Yeah, that matters too, how  the system manifests itself and how it presents itself to the world.  That really, really matters        

Sundar Pichai: 00:43:02: Oh, hugely so. There are simple UI  innovations which have changed the world and I absolutely think so. We  will see a lot more progress in the next couple of years as I think AI  itself on a self-improving track for UI itself. Today, we are  constraining the models, the models can’t quite express themselves in  terms of the UI to people. But if you think about it, we’ve kind of  boxed them in that way, but given these models can code, they should be  able to write the best interfaces to express their ideas over time.        

Lex Fridman: 00:43:46: That is an incredible idea. So the API is already open, so you create a really nice agentic system that  continuously improves the way you can be talking to an AI. But a lot of  that is the interface. And then of course the incredible multimodal  aspect of the interface that Google has been pushing.        

Sundar Pichai: 00:44:08: These models are natively multimodal.  They can easily take content from any format, put it in any format, they can write a good user interface, they probably understand your  preferences better over time. And so all this is the evolution ahead.  And so that goes back to where we started the conversation, I think  there’ll be dramatic evolutions in the years ahead.        

## P(doom)

Lex Fridman: 00:44:34: Maybe one more kitchen question. This  even further ridiculous concept of p(doom). So the philosophically  minded folks in the AI community, think about the probability that AGI  and then ASI might destroy all of human civilization. I would say my  p(doom) is about 10%. Do you ever think about this kind of long-term  threat of ASI and what would your p(doom) be?        

Sundar Pichai: 00:45:03: Look, I mean for sure. Look, I’ve both been very excited about AI, but I’ve always felt this is a technology  you have to actively think about the risks and work very, very hard to  harness it in a way that it all works out well. On the p(doom) question, look, it wouldn’t surprise you to say that’s probably another micro  kitchen conversation that pops up once in a while. And given how  powerful the technology is maybe stepping back, when you’re running a  large organization, if you can align the incentives of the organization, you can achieve pretty much anything. If you can get people all  marching towards a goal, in a very focused way, in a mission-driven way, you can pretty much achieve anything.        

00:45:50: But it’s very tough to organize all of humanity that way. But I think if p(doom) is actually high, at some  point, all of humanity is aligned in making sure that’s not the case.  And so we’ll actually make more progress against it, I think. So the  irony is, so there is a self-modulating aspect there. I think if  humanity collectively puts their mind to solving a problem, whatever, it is, I think we can get there. So because of that, I think I’m  optimistic on the p(doom) scenarios, I think the underlying risk is  actually pretty high, but I have a lot of faith in humanity kind of  rising up to meet that moment.        

Lex Fridman: 00:46:39: That’s really, really, well put. I  mean, as the threat becomes more concrete and real, humans do really  come together and get their shit together. Well, the other thing I think people don’t often talk about is probability of doom without AI. So  there’s all these other ways that humans can destroy themselves and it’s very possible, at least I believe so, that AI will help us become  smarter, kinder to each other, more efficient. It’ll help more parts of  the world flourish where it wouldn’t be less resource constrained, which is often the source of military conflict and tensions and so on. So we  also have to load into that, what’s the [inaudible 00:47:22] without AI? p(doom) with AI, p(doom) without AI, because it’s very possible that AI will be the thing that saves us, saves human civilizations from all the other threats.        

Sundar Pichai: 00:47:32: I agree with you. I think it’s  insightful. Look, I felt to make progress on some of the toughest  problems would be good to have AI, like Pear, helping you, and so that  resonates with me for sure. Yeah.        

Lex Fridman: 00:47:48: Quick pause, bathroom break? [inaudible 00:47:51].        

Sundar Pichai: 00:47:51: Let’s do that.        

Lex Fridman: 00:47:53: If NotebookLM was the same, like what I saw today with Beam, if it was compelling in the same kind of way, blew my mind. It was incredible. I didn’t think it’s possible. I didn’t  think it’s [inaudible 00:48:06].        

Sundar Pichai: 00:48:05: Can you imagine the US president and  the Chinese president being able to do something like Beam with the live Meet translation working well, so they’re both sitting and talking,  make progress a bit more.        

Lex Fridman: 00:48:20: Just for people listening, we took a  quick bathroom break and now we’re talking about the demo I did. We’ll  probably post it somewhere somehow maybe here. I got a chance to  experience Beam and it’s hard to describe in words how real it felt with just, what is it, six cameras. It’s incredible. It’s incredible.        

Sundar Pichai: 00:48:42: It’s one of the toughest products of,  you can’t quite describe it to people. Even when we show it in slides,  et cetera, you don’t know what it is. You have to kind of experience it.        

Lex Fridman: 00:48:54: On the world leaders front, on  politics, geopolitics, there’s something really special again with  studying World War II and how much could have been saved if Chamberlain  met Stalin in person. And I sometimes also struggle explaining to  people, articulating, why I believe meeting in person for world leaders  is powerful. It just seems naive to say that, but there is something  there in person and with Beam, I felt that same thing, and then I’m  unable to explain, all I kept doing is what a child does. You look real. And I mean, I don’t know if that makes meetings more productive or so  on, but it certainly makes them more, the same reason you want to show  up to work versus remote sometimes, that human connection. I don’t know  what that is, it’s hard to put into words. There’s something beautiful  about great teams collaborating on a thing that’s not captured by the  productivity of that team or by whatever on paper. Some of the most  beautiful moments you experience in life is at work. Pursuing a  difficult thing together for many months, there’s nothing like it.        

Sundar Pichai: 00:50:13: You’re in the trenches. And yeah, you do form bonds that way, for sure.        

Lex Fridman: 00:50:17: And to be able to do that somewhat  remotely in that same personal touch, I don’t know, that’s a deeply  fulfilling thing. I know a lot of people, I personally hate meetings  because a significant percent of meetings when done poorly don’t serve a clear purpose. But that’s a meeting problem, that’s not a communication problem. If you could improve the communication for the meetings that  are useful, that’s just incredible. So yeah, I was blown away by the  great engineering behind it. And then we get to see what impact that  has, that’s really interesting, but just incredible engineering. Really  impressive.        

Sundar Pichai: 00:50:51: No, it is. And obviously we’ll work  hard over the years to make it more and more accessible. But yeah, even  on a personal front outside of work meetings, a grandmother who’s far  away from her grandchild and being able to have that kind of an  interaction, all that I think will end up being very… Nothing  substitutes being in person but it’s not always possible. You could be a soldier deployed trying to talk to your loved one. So I think so that’s what inspires us.        

## Toughest leadership decisions

Lex Fridman: 00:51:24: When you and I hung out last year and  took a walk, I don’t think we talked about this, but I remember outside  of that seeing dozens of articles written by analysts and experts and so on, that Sundar Pichai should step down because the perception was that Google was definitively losing the AI race, has lost its magic touch,  in the rapidly evolving technological landscape,. And now a year later,  it’s crazy. You showed this plot of all the things that were shipped  over the past year. It’s incredible. And Gemini Pro is winning across  many benchmarks and products as we sit here today. So take me through  that experience when there’s all these articles saying you’re the wrong  guy to lead Google through this. Google is lost, is done, it’s over, to  today where Google is winning again. What were some low points during  that time?        

Sundar Pichai: 00:52:27: Look, lots to unpack. Obviously, the  main bet I made as a CEO was to really make sure the company was  approaching everything in a AI-first way, really setting ourselves up to develop AGI responsibly, and make sure we are putting out products  which embodies that, things that are very, very useful for people. So  look, I knew even through moments like that last year, I had a good  sense of what we were building internally. So I’d already made many  important decisions bringing together teams of the caliber of Brain and  DeepMind and setting up Google DeepMind. There were things like we made  the decision to invest in TPUs 10 years ago, so we knew we were scaling  up and building big models.        

00:53:33: Anytime you’re in a situation like  that, a few aspects. I’m good at tuning out noise, separating signal  from noise. Do you scuba dive? Have you…?        

Lex Fridman: 00:53:47: No.        

Sundar Pichai: 00:53:47: It’s amazing. I’m not good at it, but  I’ve done it a few times. But sometimes you jump in the ocean, it’s so  choppy, but you go down one feet under, it’s the calmest thing in the  entire universe. So there’s a version of that. Running Google, you may  as well be coaching Barcelona or Real Madrid. You have a bad season. So  there are aspects to that. But look, I’m good at tuning out the noise. I do watch out for signals. It’s important to separate the signal from  the noise. So there are good people sometimes making good points  outside, so you want to listen to it, you want to take that feedback in, but internally, you’re making a set of consequential decisions.        

00:54:39: As leaders, you’re making a lot of  decisions, many of them are inconsequential it feels like, but over time you learn that most of the decisions you’re making on a day-to-day  basis doesn’t matter. You have to make them and you’re making them just  to keep things moving. But you have to make a few consequential  decisions and we had set up the right teams, right leaders, we had  world-class researchers, we were training Gemini.        

00:55:15: Internally, there are factors which  were, for example, outside people may not have appreciated. I mean TPUs  are amazing, but we had to ramp up TPUs too. That took time to scale  actually having enough TPUs to get the compute needed. But I could see  internally the trajectory we were on and I was so excited internally  about the possible, to me this moment felt like one of the biggest  opportunities ahead for us as a company that the opportunity space ahead or the next decade, next 20 years, is bigger than what has happened in  the past. And I thought we were set up better than most companies in the world to go realize that vision.        

Lex Fridman: 00:56:04: I mean, you had to make some  consequential, bold decisions like you mentioned the merger of DeepMind  and Brain. Maybe it’s my perspective, just knowing humans, I’m sure  there’s a lot of egos involved, it’s very difficult to merge teams, and  I’m sure there were some hard decisions to be made. Can you take me  through your process of how you think through that? Do you go to pull  the trigger and make that decision? Maybe what were some painful points? How do you navigate those turbulent waters?        

Sundar Pichai: 00:56:36: Look, we were fortunate to have two  world-class teams, but you’re right, it’s like somebody coming and  telling to you, take Stanford and MIT and then put them together and  create a great department, easier said than done. But we were fortunate  in phenomenal teams, both had their strengths, they were run very  differently. Brain was kind of a lot of diverse projects, bottoms up and out of it came a lot of important research breakthroughs. DeepMind at  the time had a strong vision of how you want to build AGI, and so they  were pursuing their direction. But I think through those moments,  luckily tapping into, Jeff had expressed a desire to go back to more of a scientific individual contributor roots. He felt like management was  taking up too much of his time. And Demis naturally I think was running  DeepMind and was a natural choice there.        

00:57:41: But I think, you are right, it took us a while to bring the teams together, credit to Demis, Jeff, Koray, all  the great people there. They worked super hard to combine the best of  both worlds when you set up that team. A few sleepless nights here and  there, as we put that thing together. We were patient in how we did it  so that it works well for the long term and some of that in that moment. I think, yes, with things moving fast, I think you definitely felt the  pressure, but I think we pulled off that transition well, and I think  they’re obviously doing incredible work and there’s a lot more  incredible things ahead coming from them.        

Lex Fridman: 00:58:26: Like we talked about, you have a very  calm, even-tempered, respectful demeanor, during that time, whether it’s the merger or just dealing with the noise, were there times where  frustration boiled over? Did you have to go a bit more intense on  everybody than you usually would?        

Sundar Pichai: 00:58:48: Probably. You’re right. I think in the sense that there was a moment where we were all driving hard, but when  you’re in the trenches working with passion, you’re going to have days,  you disagree, you argue. But all that, I mean just part of the course of working intensely. And at the end of the day, all of us are doing what  we are doing because the impact it can have, we are motivated by it.        

00:59:21: For many of us, this has been a  long-term journey, and so it’s been super exciting. The positive moments far outweigh the kind of stressful moments. Just early this year, I had a chance to celebrate back-to-back over two days Nobel Prize for Geoff  Hinton and the next day a Nobel Prize for Demis and John Jumper. You  worked with people like that, all that is super inspiring.        

Lex Fridman: 00:59:48: Is there something like with you where you had to put your foot down maybe with less versus more or, I’m the  CEO and we’re doing this?        

Sundar Pichai: 01:00:01: To my earlier point about  consequential decisions you make, there are decisions you make, people  can disagree pretty vehemently, but at some point you make a clear  decision and you just ask people to commit. You can disagree, but it’s  time to disagree and commit so that we can get moving. And whether it’s  putting the foot down, it’s a natural part of what all of us have to do. And I think you can do that calmly and be very firm in the direction  you are making the decision, and I think if you’re clear actually people over time respect that, if you can make decisions with clarity.        

01:00:43: I find it very effective in meetings  where you’re making such decisions to hear everyone out. I think it’s  important, when you can, to hear everyone out. Sometimes what you’re  hearing actually influences how you think about, and you’re wrestling  with it and making a decision. Sometimes you have a clear conviction and you state, so look, this is how I feel and this is my conviction, and  you kind of place the bet and you move on.        

Lex Fridman: 01:01:13: Are there big decisions like that? I kind of intuitively assume the merger was the big one?        

Sundar Pichai: 01:01:19: I think that was a very important  decision for the company to meet the moment. I think we had to make sure we were doing that and doing that well. I think that was a  consequential decision. There were many other things. We set up a AI  infrastructure team to really go meet the moment to scale up the compute we needed to and really brought teams from disparate parts of the  company, created it to move forward.        

01:01:51: Getting people to work together  physically, both in London with DeepMind at what we call Gradient  Canopy, which is where the Mountain View Google DeepMind teams are. But  one of my favorite moments is I routinely walk multiple times per week  to the Gradient Canopy building where our top researchers are working on the models, Sergey is often there amongst them, just looking at getting an update on the model, seeing the loss curves, so all that. I think  that cultural part of getting the teams together back with that energy, I think ended up playing a big role too.        

## AI mode vs Google Search

Lex Fridman: 01:02:32: What about the decision to recently  add AI mode? So Google Search is, as they say, the front page of the  internet, it’s like a legendary minimalist thing with 10 blue links.  When people think internet, they think that page and now you’re starting to mess with that. So the AI mode, which is a separate tab, and then  integrating AI in the results, I’m sure there were some battles in  meetings on that one.        

Sundar Pichai: 01:03:02: Look, in some ways when mobile came,  people wanted answers to more questions, so we are kind of constantly  evolving it, but you’re right, this moment, that evolution because the  underlying technology is becoming much more capable. You can have AI  give a lot of context, but one of our important design goals though, is  when you come to Google Search, you are going to get a lot of context,  but you’re going to go and find a lot of things out on the web. So that  will be true in AI mode, in AI overviews, and so on.        

01:03:39: Pertaining to our earlier  conversation, we’re still giving you access to links, but think of the  AI as a layer, which is giving you context, summary, maybe in AI mode,  you can have a dialogue with it back and forth on your journey, but  through it all, you’re kind of learning what’s out there in the world.  So those core principles don’t change. But I think AI mode allows us to  push the… We have our best models there, models that are using search as a deep tool, really for every query you’re asking, kind of fanning out  doing multiple searches, kind of assembling that knowledge in a way so  that you can go and consume what you want to, and that’s how we think  about it.        

Lex Fridman: 01:04:25: I got a chance to listen to a bunch of Elizabeth, Liz Reid, describe, there’s two things stood out to me that  you mentioned. One thing is what you were talking about is the query  fan-out, which I didn’t even think about before, is the powerful aspect  of integrating a bunch of stuff on the web for you in one place, so  that, yes, it provides that context so that you can decide which page to then go onto. The other really, really big thing speaks to the earlier  in terms of productivity multiply that we’re talking about, that she  mentioned, was language.        

01:05:01: So one of the things you don’t quite  understand is through AI mode for non-English speakers, you make, let’s  say, English language websites accessible in the reasoning process as  you’ve tried to figure out what you’re looking for. Of course once you  show up to a page, you can use a basic translate, but that process of  figuring it out, if you empathize with a large part of the world that  doesn’t speak English, their web is much smaller in that original  language. And so it, again, unlocks that huge cognitive capacity there.  You take for granted here with all the bloggers and the journalists  writing about AI mode, you forget that this now unlocks because Gemini  is really good at translation.        

Sundar Pichai: 01:05:54: Oh it is. I mean the multimodality,  the translation, it’s ability to reason, we’re dramatically improving  tool use, and putting that power in the flow of Search, look, I’m super  excited with AI overviews. We’ve seen the product has gotten much  better, we measured using all kinds of user metrics. It’s obviously  driven strong growth of the product, and we’ve been testing AI mode.  It’s now in the hands of millions of people and the early metrics are  very encouraging. So look, I’m excited about this next chapter of  Search.        

Lex Fridman: 01:06:36: For people who are not thinking  through or aware of this, so there’s the 10 blue links with the AI  overview on top, that provides a nice summarization, you can expand it.        

Sundar Pichai: 01:06:45: And you have sources and links now embedded.        

Lex Fridman: 01:06:49: Yeah, I believe, at least Liz said so, I actually didn’t notice it, but there’s ads in the AI overview also. I don’t think there’s ads in AI mode. When ads in AI mode, Sundar? When  do you think…? Okay, we should say that in the nineties, I remember the  animated GIFs, banner GIFs, that take you to some shady websites that  have nothing to do with anything. AdSense revolutionized advertisement.  It’s one of the greatest inventions in recent history because it allows  us, for free, to have access to all these kinds of services. So ads fuel a lot of really powerful services. And at its best it’s showing you  relevant ads, but also very importantly in a way that’s not super  annoying, in a classy way. So when do you think it’s possible to add ads into AI mode and what does that look like from a classy, non-annoying  perspective?        

Sundar Pichai: 01:07:52: Two things. Early part of AI mode,  we’ll obviously focus more on the organic experience to make sure we are getting it right. I think the fundamental value of ads are-        

Sundar Pichai: 01:08:00: I think the fundamental value of ads  are it enables access to deploy the services to billions of people.  Second is ads are the reason we’ve always taken ads seriously is we view ads as commercial information, but it’s still information. So we bring  the same quality metrics to it. I think with AI mode, to our earlier  conversation about… I think AI itself will help us, over time, figure  out the best way to do it. I think given we are giving context around  everything, I think it’ll give us more opportunities to also explain,  “Okay, here’s some commercial information.” Like today as a podcaster,  you do it at certain spots, and you probably figure out what’s best in  your podcast. I think so, there are aspects of that, but I think the  underlying need of people value commercial information, businesses are  trying to connect to users.        

01:08:58: All that doesn’t change in an AI  moment, but look, we will rethink it. You’ve seen us in YouTube now do a mixture of subscription and ads. Like, obviously, we are now  introducing subscription offerings across everything. So as part of  that, the optimization point will end up being a different place as  well.        

Lex Fridman: 01:09:23: Do you see a trajectory in the possible future where AI mode completely replaces the 10 blue links plus AI overview?        

Sundar Pichai: 01:09:32: Our current plan is AI mode is going  to be there as a separate tab for people who really want to experience  that, but it’s not yet at the level there, our main search pages. But as features work will keep migrating it to the main page, and so you can  view it as a continuum. AI mode will offer you the bleeding edge  experience, but things that work will keep overflowing to AI overviews  and the main experience.        

Lex Fridman: 01:10:02: And the idea that AI mode will still take you to the web to human created web?        

Sundar Pichai: 01:10:06: Yes, that’s going to be a core design principle for us.        

Lex Fridman: 01:10:08: So really, if users decide, right? They drive this.        

Sundar Pichai: 01:10:11: Yeah.        

Lex Fridman: 01:10:13: It’s just exciting. A little bit scary that it might change the internet because Google has been dominating  with a very specific look and idea of what it means to have the  internet. As you move to AI mode, I mean, it’s just a different  experience. I think Liz was talking about it. I think you’ve mentioned  that you ask more questions. You ask longer questions.        

Sundar Pichai: 01:10:41: Dramatically different types of questions.        

Lex Fridman: 01:10:43: Yeah, it actually fuels curiosity. I  think, for me, I’ve been asking just a much larger number of questions  of this black box machine, let’s say, whatever it is, and with the AI  overview, it’s interesting because I still value the human… I still  ultimately want to end up on the human created web, but like you said,  the context really helps.        

Sundar Pichai: 01:11:09: It helps us deliver higher-quality  referrals, right? Where people, they have much higher likelihood of  finding what they’re looking for. They’re exploring. They’re curious.  Their intent is getting satisfied more. So that’s what all our metrics  show.        

Lex Fridman: 01:11:25: It makes the humans that create the  web nervous. The journalists are getting nervous. They’ve already been  nervous. Like we mentioned, CNN is nervous because the podcasts… It  makes people nervous.        

Sundar Pichai: 01:11:37: Look, I think news and journalism will play an important role in the future. We are pretty committed to it,  right? So I think making sure that ecosystem, in fact, I think we’ll be  able to differentiate ourselves as a company over time because of our  commitment there. So it’s something, I think, I definitely value a lot,  and as we are designing, we’ll continue prioritizing approaches.        

Lex Fridman: 01:12:05: I’m sure for the people who want, they can have a fine-tuned AI model that’s clickbait hit pieces that will  replace current journalism. That’s a shot of journalism. Forgive me. But I find that if you’re looking for really strong criticism of things,  that Gemini is very good at providing that.        

Sundar Pichai: 01:12:23: Oh, absolutely. I.        

Lex Fridman: 01:12:24: T’s better than anything they… For  now, I mean. People are concerned that there would be bias that’s  introduced that as the AI systems become more and more powerful, there’s incentive from sponsors to roll in and try to control the output of the AI models. But for now, the objective criticism that’s provided is way  better than journalism.        

01:12:46: Of course, the argument is the  journalists are still valuable, but then, I don’t know, the crowdsourced journalism that we get on the open internet is also very, very  powerful.        

Sundar Pichai: 01:12:56: I feel like they’re all super  important things. I think it’s good that you get a lot of crowdsourced  information coming in, but I feel like there is real value for  high-quality journalism, right? I think these are all complimentary, I  think. Like, I view it as I find myself constantly seeking out, also,  like, try to find objective reporting on things too. Sometimes you get  more context from the crowd-funded sources you read online, but I think  both end up playing a super important role.        

Lex Fridman: 01:13:32: So you’ve spoken a little about this.  Dennis talked about this, it’s sort of the slice of the web that will  increasingly become about providing information for agents. So we can  think about as two layers of the web. One is for humans, one is for  agents. Do you see the AI agents? Do you see the one that’s for AI  agents growing over time? Do you there still being long-term 5, 10 years value for the human created for the purpose of human consumption web,  or will it all be agents in the end?        

Sundar Pichai: 01:14:09: Today, not everyone does, but you go  to a big retail store, you love walking the aisle, you love shopping or  grocery store, picking out food, et cetera, but you’re also online  shopping, and they’re delivering, right? So both are complementary, and  that’s true for restaurants, et cetera. So I do feel like, over time,  websites will also get better for humans. They will be better design. AI might actually design them better for humans.        

01:14:41: So I expect the web to get a lot  richer, and more interesting, and better to use. At the same time, I  think there’ll be an agentic web, which is also making a lot of  progress, and you have to solve the business value and the incentives to make that work well, right? For people to participate in it.        

01:15:05: But I think both will coexist, and  obviously, the agents may not need the same… Not may not. They won’t  need the same design and the UI paradigms which humans need to interact  with. But I think both will be there.        

## Google Chrome

Lex Fridman: 01:15:23: I have to ask you about Chrome. I have to say, for me personally, Google Chrome is probably, I don’t know, I’d like to see where I would rank it, but in this temptation, and this is  not a recency bias, although it might be a little bit, but I think it’s  up there, top three, maybe the number one piece of software for me of  all time. It’s incredible. It’s really incredible.        

01:15:46: The browser is our window to the web,  and Chrome really continues for many years. But even initially, to push  the innovation on that front when it was stale, and it continues to  challenge. It continues to make it more performant, so efficient, and  just innovate constantly, and the Chromium aspect of it.        

01:16:07: Anyway, you were one of the pioneers  of Chrome pushing for it when it was an insane idea, probably one of the ideas that was criticized, and doubted, and so on. So can you tell me  the story of what it took to push for Chrome? What was your vision?        

Sundar Pichai: 01:16:29: Look, it was such a dynamic time  around 2004, 2005 with AJAX, the web suddenly becoming dynamic. In a  matter of few months, Flickr, Gmail, Google Maps, all kind of came into  existence, right? Like, the fact that you have an interactive dynamic  web. The web was evolving from simple text pages, simple HTML to rich  dynamic applications, but at the same time, you could see the browser  was never meant for that world, right? Like, JavaScript execution was  super slow.        

01:17:12: The browser was far away from being an operating system for that rich modern web which was coming into place.  So that’s the opportunity we saw. It’s an amazing early team. I still  remember the day we got a shell on WebKit running and how fast it was.  We had the clear vision for building a browser. We wanted to bring Core  OS principles into the browser, right?        

01:17:44: So we built a secure browser, sandbox. Each tab was its own. These things are common now, but at the time, it  was pretty unique. We found an amazing team in Aarhus, Denmark with a  leader who built the JavaScript VM, which at the time, was 25 times  faster than any other JavaScript VM out there. By the way, you are  right. We open-sourced it all and put it in Chromium too, but we really  thought the web could work much better, much faster, and you could be  much safer browsing the web, and the name Chrome came because literally  felt people were… Or the Chrome of the browser was getting clunkier.        

01:18:32: We wanted to minimize it. So that was  the origins of the project. Definitely, obviously, highly-biased person  here talking about Chrome, but it’s the most fun I’ve had building a  product from the ground up, and it was an extraordinary team. My  co-founders on the project were terrific, so definite fond memories.        

Lex Fridman: 01:18:56: So for people who don’t know, Sundar,  it’s probably fair to say, you’re the reason we have Chrome. Yes, I know there’s a lot of incredible engineers, but pushing for it inside a  company that probably was opposing it because it’s a crazy idea, because as everybody probably knows, it’s incredibly difficult to build a  browser.        

Sundar Pichai: 01:19:13: Yeah, look, Eric was the CEO at the  time. I think it was less that he was supposed to it. He kind of  first-hand knew what a crazy thing it is to go build a browser, and so  he definitely was like, “This is…” There was a crazy aspect to actually  wanting to go build a browser, but he was very supportive. Everyone… The founders were.        

01:19:36: I think once we started building  something, and we could use it. And see how much better, from then on,  you’re really tinkering with the product and making it better. It came  to life pretty fast.        

Lex Fridman: 01:19:48: What wisdom do you draw from that?  From pushing through on a crazy idea in the early days that ends up  being revolutionary, for future crazy ideas like it?        

Sundar Pichai: 01:20:00: I mean, this is something Larry and  Sergey have articulated clearly. I really internalized this early on,  which is their whole feeling around working on moonshots as a way. When  you work on something very ambitious, first of all, it attracts the best people, right? So that’s an advantage you get. Number two, because it’s so ambitious, you don’t have others working on something crazy. So you  pretty much have the path to yourselves, right? It’s like Waymo and  self-driving. Number three, even if you end up quite not accomplishing  what you set out to do and you end up doing 60, 80% of it, it’ll end up  being a terrific success. So that’s the advice I would give people,  right? I think it’s just aiming for big ideas, has all these advantages, and it’s risky, but it also has all these advantages which people I  don’t think fully internalize.        

Lex Fridman: 01:20:57: I mean, you mentioned one of the  craziest biggest moonshots, which is Waymo. It’s when I first saw, over a decade ago, a Waymo vehicle, a Google self-driving car vehicle. For me, it was an aha moment for robotics. It made me fall in love with  robotics even more than before. It gave me a glimpse into the future. So it’s incredible. I’m truly grateful for that project, for what it  symbolizes, but it’s also a crazy moonshot.        

01:21:28: For a long time, Waymo’s been, like  you mentioned with scuba diving, just not listening to anybody, just  calmly improving the system better, and better, more testing, just  expanding the operational domain more and more. First of all, congrats  on the 10 million paid Robotaxi rides. What lessons do you take from  Waymo about, like, the perseverance, the persistence on that project?        

Sundar Pichai: 01:21:57: Really proud of the progress we have  had with Waymo. One of the things I think we were very committed to, the final 20% can look like… I mean, we always say, right? The first 80% is easy, the final 20% takes 80% of the time. I think we definitely were  working through that phase with Waymo, but I was aware of that, but we  knew we were at that stage.        

01:22:21: We knew while there were many other  self-driving companies, we knew the technology gap was there. In fact,  right at the moment, when others were doubting Waymo is when, I don’t  know, made the decision to invest more in Waymo, right? Because so in  some ways it’s counterintuitive, but I think, look, we’ve always been a  deep technology company, and waymo is a version of kind of building a AI robot that works well, and so we get attracted to problems like that.  The caliber of the teams there, phenomenal teams.        

01:23:03: So I know you followed the space super closely. I’m talking to someone who knows the space well, but it was  very obvious, it’s going to get there, and there’s still more work to  do, but it’s a good example where we always prioritized being ambitious  and safety at the same time, right? Equally committed to both and pushed hard and couldn’t be more thrilled with how it’s working, how much  people love the experience. This year, definitely, we’ve scaled up a  lot, and we’ll continue scaling up in ’26.        

Lex Fridman: 01:23:42: That said, the competition is heating  up. You’ve been friendly with Elon even though, technically, he’s a  competitor, but you’ve been friendly with a lot of tech CEOs, in that  way, just showing respect towards them and so on. What do you think  about the Robotaxi efforts that Tesla is doing? Do you see it as  competition? What do you think? Do you like the competition?        

Sundar Pichai: 01:24:02: We are one of the earliest and biggest backers of SpaceX as Google, right? So thrilled with what SpaceX is  doing and fortunate to be investors as a company there, right? We don’t  compete with Tesla directly. We are not making cars, et cetera, right?  We are building L4, 5 autonomy. We are building a Waymo driver, which is general purpose and can be used in many settings.        

01:24:32: They’re obviously working on making  Tesla self-driving too. I’ve just assumed it’s a de facto that Elon  would succeed in whatever it does. So that is not something I question,  but I think we are so far from… These spaces are such vast spaces. Like, I think about transportation, the opportunity space, the Waymo driver  is a general purpose technology we can apply in many situations. So you  have a vast green space in all future scenarios, I see Tesla doing well  and Waymo doing well.        

Lex Fridman: 01:25:13: Like we mentioned with the Neolithic  package, I think it’s very possible that in the “AI package” when the  history is written, autonomous vehicles, self-driving cars is like the  big thing that changes everything. Imagine, over a period of a decade or two, just the complete transition from manually-driven to autonomous,  in ways we might not predict, it might change the way we move about the  world completely.        

01:25:41: So the possibility of that and then  the second and third order effects, as you’re seeing now with Tesla,  very possibly, would see some… Internally, with Alphabet, maybe Waymo,  maybe some of the Gemini robotics stuff, it might lead you into the  other domains of robotics because we should remember that Waymo is a  robot.        

Sundar Pichai: 01:26:04: Mm-hmm.        

Lex Fridman: 01:26:05: It just happens to be on four wheels.  So you said that the next big thing, we can also throw that into AI  package. The big aha moment might be in the space of robotics. What do  you think that would look like?        

Sundar Pichai: 01:26:20: Demis and the Google DeepMind team is very focused on Gemini robotics, right?        

Lex Fridman: 01:26:20: Yeah.        

Sundar Pichai: 01:26:23: So we are definitely building the  underlying model as well. So we have a lot of investments there, and I  think we are also pretty cutting-edge in our research there. So we are  definitely driving that direction. We obviously are thinking about  applications in robotics. We’ll kind of work CSD. We are partnering with a few companies today, but it’s an area I would say stay tuned.        

01:26:48: We are yet to fully articulate our  plans outside, but it’s an area we are definitely committed to driving a lot of progress. But I think AI ends up driving that massive progress  on robotics. The field has been held back for a while. I mean, hardware  has made extraordinary progress. The software had been the challenge,  but with AI now and the generalized models we are building, we are  building these models, getting them to work in the real world in a safe  way, in a generalized way is the frontier we are pushing pretty hard on.        

Lex Fridman: 01:27:25: Well, it’s really nice to see the  models and the different teams integrated to where all of them are  pushing towards one world model that’s being built. So from all these  different angles, multimodal, you’re ultimately trying to get Gemini. So the same thing that would make AI mode really effective in answering  your questions, which requires a kind of world model is the same kind of thing that would help a robot be useful in the physical world. So  everything’s aligned.        

Sundar Pichai: 01:27:54: That is what makes this moment so  unique because running, a company for the first time, you can do one  investment in a very deep horizontal way. On top of it, you can drive  multiple businesses forward, right? That’s effectively what we are doing in Google and Alphabet, right?        

Lex Fridman: 01:28:14: Yeah, it’s all coming together. Like,  it was planned ahead of time, but it’s not, of course. It’s all  distributed. I mean, if Gmail, and Sheets, and all these other  incredible services, I can sing Gmail praises for years. I mean, just  this revolutionized email.        

01:28:28: But the moment you start to integrate  AI Gemini into Gmail, I mean that’s the other thing, speaking of  productivity multiplier, people complain about email, but that changed  everything. Email, like the invention of email changed everything, and  it has been ripe. There’s been a few folks trying to revolutionize  email. Some of them on top of Gmail, but that’s like ripe for  innovation, not just spam filtering, but you demoed a really nice demo  of-        

Sundar Pichai: 01:28:55: Personalized responses, right?        

Lex Fridman: 01:28:56: Personalized responses. At first, I  felt really bad about that, but then I realized that there’s nothing  wrong to feel bad about because the example you gave is when a friend  asks you went to whatever hiking location, “Do you have any advice?” It  just searches through all your information to give them good advice, and then you put the cherry on top, maybe some love, or whatever  camaraderie, but the informational aspect, the knowledge transfer, it  does for you.        

Sundar Pichai: 01:29:28: I think there’ll be important moments. Like, today, if you write a card in your own handwriting and send it to someone, that’s a special thing. Similarly, there’ll be a time, I mean, to your friends, maybe your friend wrote and said he’s not doing well  or something, those are moments you want to save your times for writing  something, reaching out. But like saying, “Give me all the details of  the trip you took to me makes a lot of sense for AI assistant to help  you.” Right?        

01:29:59: So I think both are important, but I think I’m excited about that direction.        

Lex Fridman: 01:30:04: Yeah, I think, ultimately, it gives  more time for us humans to do the things we humans find meaningful. I  think it scares a lot of people because we’re going to have to ask  ourselves the hard question of what do we find meaningful? I’m sure  there’s answers, and it’s the old question of the meaning of existence.  As you have to try to figure that out, that might be ultimately  parenting, or being creative in some domains of art or writing, and it  challenges to…        

01:30:32: It’s a good question of to ask  yourself like, “In my life, what is the thing that brings me most joy  and fulfillment?” If I’m able to actually focus more time on that,  that’s really powerful.        

Sundar Pichai: 01:30:45: I think that’s the holy grail. If you get this right, I think it allows more people to find that.        

## Programming

Lex Fridman: 01:30:52: I have to ask you, on the programming  front, AI is getting really good at programming. Gemini, both the  agentic and just the LLM has been incredible, so a lot of programmers  are really worried that they will lose their jobs. How worried should  they be, and how should they adjust so they can be thriving in this new  world, or more and more code is written by AI?        

Sundar Pichai: 01:31:16: I think a few things. Looking at  Google, we’ve given various stats around 30% of code now uses AI-  generated suggestions or whatever it is. But the most important metric,  and we carefully measure it is, like, how much has our engineering  velocity increased as a company due to AI, right? It’s tough measure,  and we rigorously try to measure it, and our estimates are that number  is now at 10%, right?        

01:31:51: Like, now, across the company, we’ve  accomplished a 10% engineering velocity increase using AI, but we plan  to hire more engineers next year, right? Because the opportunity space  of what we can do is expanding too, right?        

Lex Fridman: 01:32:14: Mm-hmm.        

Sundar Pichai: 01:32:15: So I think, hopefully, at least in the near to midterm, for many engineers, it frees up more and more of the…  Even in engineering and coding, there are aspects which are so much fun. You’re designing. You’re architecting. You’re solving a problem.  There’s a lot of grant work, which all goes hand in hand, but hopefully, it takes a lot of that away, makes it even more fun to code ,frees you  up more time to create, problem, solve, brainstorm with your fellow  colleagues and so on, right? So that’s the opportunity there.        

01:32:56: Second, I think it’ll attract, it’ll  put the creative power in more people’s hands, which means people will  create more. That means there’ll be more engineers doing more things. So it’s tough to fully predict, but I think in general, in this moment, it feels like people adopt these tools and be better programmers. Like,  there are more people playing chess now than ever before, right? So it  feels positive that way, to me, at least, speaking from within a Google  context, is how I would talk to them about it.        

Lex Fridman: 01:33:36: Still. I just know anecdotally, a lot  of great programmers are generating a lot of code, so their  productivity, they’re not always using all the code. There’s still a lot of editing, but even for me, still programming as a side thing, I think I’m like 5x more productive. I think even for a large code base that’s  touching a lot of users like Google’s does, I’m imagining, very soon,  that productivity should be going up even more.        

Sundar Pichai: 01:34:08: No. The big unlock will be as we make  the agentic capabilities much more robust, right? I think that’s what  unlocks that next big wave. I think the 10% is a massive number. Like,  if tomorrow, I showed up and said, “You can improve a large  organization’s productivity by 10%,” when you have tens of thousands of  engineers, that’s a phenomenal number, and that’s different than what  other site or statistic saying like, “This percentage of code is now  written by AI.”        

01:34:41: I’m talking more about, like, overall-        

Lex Fridman: 01:34:42: The actual productivity.        

Sundar Pichai: 01:34:43: The actual productivity. Right?  Engineering productivity, which is two different things, which is the  more important metric, but I think it’ll get better, right? I think  there’s no engineer who, tomorrow, if you magically became 2x more  productive, it’s just going to create more things. You’re going to  create more value-added things, and so I think you’ll find more  satisfaction in your job, right?        

Lex Fridman: 01:35:08: There’s a lot of aspects. I mean, the  actual Google code base might just improve because it’ll become more  standardized, more easier for people to move about the code base because AI will help with that, and therefore, that will also allow the AI to  understand the entire code base better, which makes the engineering  aspect.        

01:35:25: So I’ve been using Cursor a lot as a  way to program with Gemini and other models. One of its powerful things  is it’s aware of the entire code base, and that allows you to ask  questions of it. It allows the agents to move about that code base in a  really powerful way. I mean, that’s a huge unlock.        

Sundar Pichai: 01:35:44: Think about, like, migrations, refactoring old code bases.        

Lex Fridman: 01:35:52: Refactoring, yeah.        

Sundar Pichai: 01:35:52: Yeah. I mean, think about once we can do all this in a much better, more robust way than where we are today.        

Lex Fridman: 01:35:57: I think in the end, everything will be written in JavaScript and run in Chrome. I think it’s all going to that direction. I mean, just for fun, Google has legendary coding  interviews, like rigorous interviews for the engineers. Can you comment  on how that has changed in the era of AI? It’s just such a weird… The  whiteboard interview, I assume, is not allowed to have some prompts.        

Sundar Pichai: 01:36:24: Such a good question. Look, we are  making sure we’ll introduce at least one round of in-person interviews  for people just to make sure the fundamentals are there. I think they’ll end up being important, but it’s an equally important skill. Look, if  you can use these tools to generate better code, I think that’s an  asset. So overall, I think it’s a massive positive.        

Lex Fridman: 01:36:56: Vibe coding engineer, do you recommend people, students interested in programming still get an education in  computer science in college education? What do you think?        

Sundar Pichai: 01:37:06: I do. If you have a passion for  computer science, I would. Computer science is obviously a lot more than programming alone, so I would. I still don’t think I would change what  you pursue. I think AI will horizontally allow impact every field. It’s  pretty tough to predict in what ways. So any education in which you’re  learning good first principles thinking, I think, is good education.        

## Android

Lex Fridman: 01:37:37: You’ve revolutionized web browsing.  You’ve revolutionized a lot of things over the years. Android changed  the game. It’s an incredible operating system. We could talk for hours  about Android. What does the future of Android look like? Is it possible it becomes more and more AI-centric, especially now you throw into the  mix, Android XR, with being able to do augmented reality, and mixed  reality, and virtual reality in the physical world?        

Sundar Pichai: 01:38:09: The best innovations in computing have come through a paradigm IO change, right? When with GUI, and then with a graphical user interface, and then with multi-touch in the context of  mobile voice later on. Similarly, I feel like AR is that next paradigm. I think it was held back. Both the system integration challenges of  making good AR is very, very hard.        

01:38:38: The second thing is you need AI to  actually kind of… Otherwise, the IO is too complicated for you to have a natural seamless IO to that paradigm. AI ends up being super important, and so this is why Project Astra ends up being super critical for that  Android XR world. But it is. I think when you use glasses and… Always  been amazed at how useful these things are going to be.        

01:39:10: So look, I think it’s a real  opportunity for Android. I think XR is one way it’ll kind of really come to life, but I think there’s an opportunity to rethink the mobile OS  too, right? I think we’ve been kind of living in this paradigm of apps  and shortcuts. All that won’t go away.        

01:39:28: But again, if you’re trying to get  stuff done at an operating system level, it needs to be more agentic so  that you can kind of describe what you want to do or it proactively  understands what you’re trying to do, learns from how you’re doing  things over and over again and kind of as adapting to you all. That is  kind of like the unlock we need to go and do.        

Lex Fridman: 01:39:51: Well, the basic efficient minimalist  UI. I’ve gotten a chance to try the glasses and they’re incredible. It’s the little stuff. It’s hard to put into words, but no latency. It just  works. Even that little map demo, where you look down and you look up,  and there’s a very smooth transition between the two, and very small  amount of useful information is shown to you, enough not to distract  from the world outside, but enough to provide a bit of context when you  need it.        

01:40:25: In order to bring that into reality,  you have to solve a lot of the OS problems to make sure it works when  you’re integrating the AI into the whole thing. So everything you do  launches an agent that answers some basic question.        

Sundar Pichai: 01:40:39: Good moonshot, you know?        

Lex Fridman: 01:40:39: Yeah, it’s crazy.        

Sundar Pichai: 01:40:42: I love it. But I think we are, but  it’s much closer to reality than other moonshots. We expect to have  classes in the hands of developers later this year and in consumer  science next year. So it’s an exciting time.        

Lex Fridman: 01:40:59: Yeah, well, extremely well-executed  beam, all this stuff, because sometimes you don’t know. Like, somebody  commented on a top comment on one of the demos of Beam. They said, “This will either be killed off in five weeks or revolutionize all meetings  in five years.” And there’s very much, Google tries so many things, and  sometimes, sadly, kills off very promising projects. But because there’s so many other things to focus on.        

01:41:27: I use so many Google products. Google  Voice, I still use. I’m so glad that’s not being killed off. That’s  still alive. Thank you, whoever is defending that, because it’s awesome, and it’s great. They keep innovating. I just want to list off, just as a big thank you, so Search, obviously, Google revolutionized, Chrome, and all of these could be multi-hour conversations. Gmail, I’ve been  singing Gmail praises forever. Maps, incredible technological innovation on revolutionizing mapping. Android, like we talked about. YouTube,  like we talked about. AdSense, Google Translate for the academic mind…        

Lex Fridman: 01:42:01: … Google Translate. For the academic  mind Google Scholar is incredible. And also the scanning of the books.  So making all the world’s knowledge accessible, even with that knowledge is a kind of niche thing, which Google Scholar is. And then obviously  with DeepMind, with AlphaZero, AlphaFold and AlphaEvolve, I could talk  forever about AlphaEvolve. That’s mind-blowing. All of that released.  And as part of that set of things you’ve released in this year when  those brilliant articles were written about Google is done. And like we  talked about, pioneering self-driving cars and quantum computing, which  could be another thing that is low-key that’s scuba diving its way to  changing the world forever. So another pothead/ [inaudible 01:42:53]  question. If you build AGI, what kind of question would you ask it? What would you want to talk about? Definitively, Google has created AGI that can basically answer any question. What topic are you going to? Where  are you going?        

## Questions for AGI

Sundar Pichai: 01:43:14: It’s a great question. Maybe it’s  proactive by then and should tell me a few things I should know. But I  think if I were to ask it, I think it’ll help us understand ourselves  much better in a way that’ll surprise us, I think. And so maybe that,  you already see people do it with the products, but in a AGI context, I  think that’ll be pretty powerful.        

Lex Fridman: 01:43:43: On a personal level, or a general human nature?        

Sundar Pichai: 01:43:46: At a personal level.        

Lex Fridman: 01:43:46: Okay.        

Sundar Pichai: 01:43:47: So you talking to AGI, I think there  is some chance it’ll understand you in a very deep way, I think in a  profound way, that’s a possibility. I think there is also the obvious  thing of maybe it helps us understand the universe better in a way that  expands the frontiers of our understanding of the world. That is  something super exciting. But look, I really don’t know. I think I  haven’t had access to something that powerful yet, but I think those are all possibilities.        

Lex Fridman: 01:44:29: I think on the personal level, asking  questions about yourself, a sequence of questions like that about what  makes me happy, I think we would be very surprised to learn through a  sequence of questions and answers, we might explore some profound truths in a way that sometimes art reveals to us, great books reveal to us,  great conversations with loved ones reveal. Things that are obvious in  retrospect, but are nice when they’re said. But for me, number one  question is about, how many alien civilizations are there? 100%.        

Sundar Pichai: 01:45:05: That’s going to be your first question?        

Lex Fridman: 01:45:06: Number one, how many living and dead  alien civilizations? Maybe a bunch of follow-ups, like how close are  they? Are they dangerous? If there’s no alien civilizations, why? Or if  there’s no advanced alien civilizations, but bacteria-like life  everywhere. Why? What is the barrier preventing it from getting to that? Is it because that when you get sufficiently intelligent, you end up  destroying ourselves, because you need competition in order to develop  an advanced civilization. And when you have competition it’s going to  lead to military conflict, and conflict eventually kills everybody. I  don’t know, I’m going to have that kind of discussion.        

Sundar Pichai: 01:45:47: Get an answer to the Fermi Paradox, yeah.        

Lex Fridman: 01:45:49: Exactly. And have a real discussion  about it. I’m realizing now with your answer is a more productive  answer, because I’m not sure what I’m going to do with that information. But maybe it speaks to the general human curiosity that Liz talked  about, that we’re all just really curious, and making the world’s  information accessible allows our curiosity to be satiated some with AI  even more, we can be more and more curious and learn more about the  world, about ourselves. And in so doing, I always wonder, I don’t know  if you can comment on, is it possible to measure the, not the GDP  productivity increase like we talked about, but maybe whatever that  increases, the breadth and depth of human knowledge that Google has  unlocked with Google Search, and now with AI mode with Gemini, it’s a  difficult thing to measure.        

Sundar Pichai: 01:46:47: Many years ago there was, I think it  was a MIT study, they just estimated the impact of Google Search. And  they basically said it’s the equivalent to, on a per person basis, it’s  few thousands of dollars per year per person, like is the value that got created per year. But yeah, it’s tough to capture these things, right?  You kind of take it for granted as these things come, and the frontier  keeps moving. But how do you measure the value of something like  AlphaFold over time, and so on?        

Lex Fridman: 01:47:25: And also the increasing quality of  life when you learn more. I have to say with some of the programming I  do done by AI, for some reason I’m more excited to program.        

Sundar Pichai: 01:47:35: Yeah.        

Lex Fridman: 01:47:36: And so the same with knowledge, with  discovering things about the world, it makes you more excited to be  alive. It makes you more curious, and the more curious, you are more  exciting it is to live and experience the world. And it’s very hard to… I don’t know if that makes you more productive. Probably not nearly as  much as it makes you happy to be alive. And that’s a hard thing to  measure, the quality of life increases some of these things do. As AI  continues to get better and better at everything that humans do, what do you think is the biggest thing that makes us humans special?        

## Future of humanity

Sundar Pichai: 01:48:14: Look, I think [inaudible 01:48:19] the essence of humanity, there’s something about the consciousness we have, what makes us uniquely human, maybe the lines will blur over time. And  it’s tough to articulate. But I hope, hopefully we live in a world where if you make resources more plentiful and make the world lesser of a  zero-sum game over time, which it’s not, but in a resource constrained  environment, people perceive it to be. And so I hope the values of what  makes us uniquely human, empathy, kindness, all that surfaces more is  the aspirational hope I have.        

Lex Fridman: 01:49:11: Yeah, it multiplies the compassion,  but also the curiosity, just the banter, the debates we’ll have about  the meaning of it all. And I also think in the scientific domains, all  the incredible work that DeepMind is doing, I think we’ll still continue to play, to explore scientific questions, mathematical questions,  physics questions, even as AI gets better and better at helping us solve some of the questions. Sometimes the question itself is a really  difficult thing.        

Sundar Pichai: 01:49:43: Both the right new questions to ask  and the answers to them and the self-discovery process, which it’ll  drive, I think. Our early work with both co-scientist and AlphaEvolve,  just super exciting to see.        

Lex Fridman: 01:49:59: What gives you hope about the future of human civilization.        

Sundar Pichai: 01:50:04: I’m an optimist, and I look at, if you were to say you take the journey of human civilization, we have  relentlessly made the world better in many ways. At any given moment in  time, there are big issues to work through it may look, but I always ask myself the question, would you have been born now or any other time in  the past? I most often, not most often, almost always would rather be  born now. And so that’s the extraordinary thing the human civilization  has accomplished, and we’ve kind of constantly made the world a better  place. And so something tells me as humanity, we always rise  collectively to drive that frontier forward. So I expect it to be no  different in the future.        

Lex Fridman: 01:51:00: I agree with you totally. I’m truly  grateful to be alive in this moment. And I’m also really excited for the future, and the work you and the incredible teams here are doing is one of the big reasons I’m excited for the future. So thank you. Thank you  for all the cool products you’ve built. And please don’t kill Google  Voice. Thank you, Sundar.        

Sundar Pichai: 01:51:21: We won’t. Yeah.        

Lex Fridman: 01:51:22: Thank you for talking today. This was incredible. Thank you.        

Sundar Pichai: 01:51:24: Real pleasure. Appreciate it.        

## Demo: Google Beam

Lex Fridman: 01:51:27: Thanks for listening to this  conversation with Sundar Pichai. To support this podcast, please check  out our sponsors in the description or at lexfridman.com/sponsors.  Shortly before this conversation, I got a chance to get a couple of  demos that frankly blew my mind. The engineering was really impressive.  The first demo was Google Beam, and the second demo was the XR glasses.  And some of it was caught on video, so I thought I would include here  some of those video clips.        

Andrew: 01:52:01: Hey Lex, my name’s Andrew.        

Lex Fridman: 01:52:03: How you doing?        

Andrew: 01:52:03: I lead the Google Beam team and we’re  going to be excited to show you a demo. We’re going to show you, I  think, a glimpse of something new. So that’s the idea, a way to connect, a way to feel present from anywhere with anybody you care about. Here’s Google Beam. This is a development platform that we’ve built. So  there’s a prototype here of Google Beam. There’s one right down the  hallway. I’m going to go down and turn that on in a second. We’re going  to experience it together. We’ll be back in the same room.        

Lex Fridman: 01:52:26: Wonderful. Whoa. Okay.        

Andrew: 01:52:27: Hey Lex, here we are.        

Lex Fridman: 01:52:27: All right. This is real already. Wow.        

Andrew: 01:52:27: This is real.        

Lex Fridman: 01:52:27: Wow.        

Andrew: 01:52:37: Good to see you. This is Google Beam.  We’re trying to make it feel like you and I could be anywhere in the  world, but when these magic windows open, we’re back together. I see you exactly the same way you see me. It’s almost like we’re sitting at the  table sharing a table together, I could learn from you, talk to you,  share a meal with you, get to know you.        

Lex Fridman: 01:52:37: So you can feel the depth of this.        

Andrew: 01:52:37: Yeah, great to meet you.        

Lex Fridman: 01:52:58: Wow. So for people who probably can’t even imagine what this looks like, there’s a 3D version. It looks real. You look real.        

Andrew: 01:53:06: Yeah. It looks to me. It looks real to you.        

Lex Fridman: 01:53:06: It looks like you’re coming out of the screen.        

Andrew: 01:53:09: We quickly believe once we’re in Beam that we’re just together. You settle into it.        

Lex Fridman: 01:53:15: Yeah.        

Andrew: 01:53:15: You’re naturally attuned to seeing the world like this, and you just get used to seeing people this way, but  literally from anywhere in the world with these magic screens.        

Lex Fridman: 01:53:23: This is incredible.        

Andrew: 01:53:23: It’s a neat technology.        

Lex Fridman: 01:53:25: Wow. So I saw demos of this, but they  don’t come close to the experience of this. I think one of the top  YouTube comments and one of the demos I saw was like, why would I want a high definition? I am trying to turn off the camera. But this actually, this feels like the camera has been turned off and we’re just in the  same room together. This is really compelling.        

Andrew: 01:53:44: That’s right. I know it’s kind of late in the day too. So I brought you a snack just in case you’re a little bit hungry.        

Lex Fridman: 01:53:50: So can you push it farther and it just becomes-        

Andrew: 01:53:52: Yeah. Let’s try to float it between rooms. It kind of fades it from my room into yours.        

Lex Fridman: 01:53:56: And then you see my hand. The depth of my hand.        

Andrew: 01:53:59: Yeah, of course. Yes.        

Lex Fridman: 01:54:00: Wow.        

Andrew: 01:54:00: Of course, yeah. It feels like you… Try this, try give me a high five. And there’s almost a sensation of being in touch.        

Lex Fridman: 01:54:00: Yes.        

Andrew: 01:54:00: You almost feel.        

Lex Fridman: 01:54:05: Yes.        

Andrew: 01:54:06: Because you’re so attuned to that should be a high five, it feeling like you could connect with somebody that way.        

Lex Fridman: 01:54:06: Yeah.        

Andrew: 01:54:11: So it’s kind of a magical experience.        

Lex Fridman: 01:54:12: Oh, this is really nice. How much does it cost?        

Andrew: 01:54:14: Yeah. We’ve got a lot of companies  testing it. We just announced that we’re going to be bringing it to  offices soon as a set of products. We’ve got some companies helping us  build these screens. But eventually, I think this will be in almost  every screen.        

Lex Fridman: 01:54:26: There’s nothing, I’m not wearing  anything. Well, I’m wearing a suit and tie to clarify, I am wearing  clothes. This is not CGI. But outside of that, cool. And the audio is  really good. And you can see me in the same three-dimensional way.        

Andrew: 01:54:40: Yeah, the audio is spatialized. So if  I’m talking from here, of course it sounds like I’m talking from here.  If I move to the other side of the room to here.        

Lex Fridman: 01:54:41: Wow.        

Andrew: 01:54:48: So these little subtle cues, these  really matter to bring people together, all the non-verbals, all the  emotion, the things that are lost today. Here it is. We put it back into the system.        

Lex Fridman: 01:54:57: You pulled this off. Holy shit, they pulled it off. And integrated into this, I saw the translation also. This is the-        

Andrew: 01:55:05: Yeah, we’ve got a bunch of things. Let me show you a couple kind of cool things. Let’s do a little bit of work together. Maybe we could critique one of your latest videos. So you and I work together, so of course we’re in the same room. But with the  super power, I can bring other things in here with me. And it’s nice.  It’s like we could sit together, we could watch something. We could  work. We’ve shared meals as a team together in this system. But once you do the presence aspect of this, you want to bring some other  superpowers to it.        

Lex Fridman: 01:55:35: Wow. And so you could do review code together.        

Andrew: 01:55:38: Yeah, yeah, exactly. I’ve got some  slides I’m working on. Maybe you could help me with this. Keep your eyes on me for a second. I’ll slide back into the center. I didn’t really  move. But the system just kind of puts us in the right spot and knows  where we need to be.        

Lex Fridman: 01:55:50: Oh, so you just turned to your laptop, the system moves you, and then it does the overlay automatically.        

Andrew: 01:55:55: It kind of warps the room to put things in the spot that they need to be in.        

Lex Fridman: 01:55:58: Yeah.        

Andrew: 01:55:59: Everything has a place in the room,  everything has a sense of presence or spatial consistency. And that  makes it feel like we’re together with us and other things.        

Lex Fridman: 01:56:06: I should also say, you’re not just  three-dimensional, it feels like you’re leaning out of the screen,  you’re coming out of the screen. You’re not just in that world  three-dimensionaly. Yeah, exactly. Holy crap. Move back to center. Okay.        

Andrew: 01:56:23: Let me tell you how this works. You  probably already have the premise of it. But there’s two things, two  really hard things that we put together. One is a AI video model. So  there’s a set of cameras, you asked about those earlier. There’s six  color cameras, just like webcams that we have today, taking video  streams and feeding them into our AI model and turning that into a 3D  video of you and I. It’s effectively a light field. So it’s kind of an  interactive 3D video that you can see from any perspective. That’s  transmitted over to the second thing. And that’s a light field display.  And it’s happening bidirectionally. I see you and you see me both in our light field displays. These are effectively flat televisions or flat  displays, but they have the sense of dimensionality, depth, size is  correct. You can see shadows and lighting are correct. And everything’s  correct from your vantage point.        

01:57:12: So if you move around ever so  slightly, and I hold still, you see a different perspective here. You  see kind of things that were included become revealed. You see shadows  that move in the way they should move. All of that’s computed and  generated using our AI video model for you. It’s based on your eye  position, where does the right scene need to be placed in this light  field display for you just to feel present?        

Lex Fridman: 01:57:33: It’s real time. No latency. I’m not seeing latency. You weren’t freezing up at all.        

Andrew: 01:57:37: No, no, I hope not. I think it’s you  and I together real time. That’s what you need for real communication.  And at a quality level it’s realistic.        

Lex Fridman: 01:57:46: This is awesome. Is it possible to do three people? Is that going to move that way also?        

Andrew: 01:57:50: Yeah. Let me kind of show you. So if  she enters the room with us, you can see her, you can see me. And if we  had more people, you eventually lose a sense of presence. You kind of  shrink people down. You lose a sense of scale. So think of it as the  window fits a certain number of people. If you want to fit a big group  of people, you want the boardroom or the big room, you need a much wider window. If you want to see just grandma and the kids, you can do  smaller windows. So everybody has a seat at the table, or everybody has a sense of where they belong, and there’s this sense of presence that’s  obeyed. If you have too many people, you kind of go back to 2D metaphors that we’re used to people in tiles placed anywhere.        

Lex Fridman: 01:58:27: For the image I’m seeing, did you have to get scanned?        

Andrew: 01:58:29: I mean, I see you without being  scanned. So it’s just so much easier if you don’t have to wear anything. You don’t have to pre-scan.        

Lex Fridman: 01:58:34: Yeah.        

Andrew: 01:58:34: And you just do it the way it’s supposed to happen without anybody having to learn anything or put anything on.        

Lex Fridman: 01:58:39: I thought you had to solve the scanning problem. But here you don’t. It’s just cameras. Its just vision.        

Andrew: 01:58:46: That’s right. It’s video. Yeah, we’re  not trying to make an approximation of you, because everything you do  every day matters. I cut myself shaving, I put on a pin. All the little  kind of aspects of you, those just happen. We don’t have the time to  scan or kind of capture those or dress avatars. We kind of appear as we  appear. And so all that’s transmitted truthfully as it’s happening.        

## Demo: Google XR Glasses

Speaker 3: 01:59:10: How you doing?        

Lex Fridman: 01:59:11: Good to meet you.        

Speaker 3: 01:59:12: Nice to meet you. So as Max mentioned, got the eye glasses here. We start with the foundation of great  glasses, something stylish, lightweight, wearable. Then we say how can  we build great technology and experiences on top of that? One of the  core tenets of the Android XR platform, this idea of a multimodal  conversational device. See what you see, hear what you hear. So you’ve  got a camera, you’ve got speakers, multiple microphones for speaker  isolation. I’ll give you a chance to try these yourself. Yeah, sorry, I  woke it up there.        

Lex Fridman: 01:59:37: Whoa.        

Speaker 3: 01:59:39: Yeah. So the first thing you see is a super simple, straightforward home screen.        

Lex Fridman: 01:59:45: Yes.        

Speaker 3: 01:59:45: So you probably see the time, the  weather, calendar, appointments there. This is designed to be sort of  your one-stop shop for quick glanceable information throughout the day.  We want it to do something that’s easy to get what you need, and then go back to what you’re doing. So you can imagine turning on the display,  getting that quick glance, and then continuing on your way. You can be  fully conversational at this point. You can ask questions for example  about the paintings. You can interrupt. You can ask follow up questions. And as I mentioned before, if you want to at any time, pause, you just  tap there on the right.        

Lex Fridman: 02:00:12: Gemini, how much does this painting cost?        

Gemini: 02:00:15: The painting is called the Bridge of  Louis-Philippe, 1875 by Armand Guillaumin. It appears to be a print. And it would be impossible to know it’s cost without finding the seller.        

Lex Fridman: 02:00:25: Okay, so this is fake. I understand. Why do humans pay so much money for paintings?        

Gemini: 02:00:30: People pay a lot for paintings,  because of their artistic merits, the artist’s name and rarity, and for  the appreciation you learn.        

Speaker 3: 02:00:38: So a few more things that we want to  show you just for sake of time, you go ahead and long press on the side  again to salute Gemini there. There you go. Did you catch Google I/O  last week by any chance?        

Lex Fridman: 02:00:48: Yes.        

Speaker 3: 02:00:48: So you might’ve seen on stage the  Google Maps experience very briefly. I wanted to give you a chance to  get a sense of what that feels like today. You can imagine you’re  walking down the street. If you look up like you’re walking straight  ahead, you get quick turn-by-turn directions, so you have a sense of  what the next turn is like.        

Lex Fridman: 02:00:48: Whoa. Nice.        

Speaker 3: 02:01:05: Keeping your phone in your pocket.        

Lex Fridman: 02:01:06: Oh, that’s so intuitive.        

Speaker 3: 02:01:07: Sometimes you need that quick sense of which way’s the right way?        

Lex Fridman: 02:01:08: Yeah. Sometimes.        

Speaker 3: 02:01:14: Yeah. So let’s say you’re coming out  of Subway, getting out of a cab. You can just glance down at your feet.  We have it set up to translate from Russian to English. I think I get to wear the glasses and you speak to me, if you don’t mind.        

Lex Fridman: 02:01:22: I can speak Russian. [foreign language 02:01:27].        

Speaker 3: 02:01:29: I’m doing well. How are you doing?        

Lex Fridman: 02:01:30: I’m tempted to swear, tempted to say inappropriate things. [foreign language 02:01:37].        

Speaker 3: 02:01:41: I see it transcribed in real time. And so obviously based on the different languages and the sequence of  subjects and verbs, there’s a slight delay sometimes, but it’s really  just like subtitles for the real world. Cool.        

## Biggest invention in human history

Lex Fridman: 02:01:53: Thank you for this. All right, back to me. Hopefully watching videos of me having my mind blown like the apes  in 2001 Space Odyssey playing with a monolith was somewhat interesting.  Like I said, I was very impressed. And now I thought, if it’s okay, I  could make a few additional comments about the episode and just in  general. In this conversation with Sundar Pichai, I discussed the  concept of the Neolithic package, which is the set of innovations that  came along with the first agricultural revolution about 12,000 years  ago, which included the formation of social hierarchies, the early  primitive forms of government, labor specialization, domestication of  plants and animals, early forms of trade, large scale cooperations of  humans like that required to build, yes, the pyramids and temples like  Göbekli Tepe. I think this may be the right way to actually talk about  the inventions that changed human history, not just as a single  invention, but as a kind of network of innovations and transformations  that came along with it.        

02:03:02: And the productivity multiplier  framework that I mentioned in the episode, I think is a nice way to try  to concretize the impact of each of these inventions under  consideration. And we have to remember that each node in the network of  the fast follow-on inventions is in itself a productivity multiplier.  Some are additive, some are multiplicative. So in some sense, the size  of the network in the package is the thing that matters when you’re  trying to rank the impact of inventions on human history. The easy picks for the period of biggest transformation, at least in sort of modern  day discourse is the Industrial Revolution, or even in the 20th century, the computer or the internet. I think it’s because it’s easiest to  intuit for modern day humans, the exponential impact of those  technologies.        

02:04:05: But recently, I suppose this changes  week to week, but I have been doing a lot of reading on ancient human  history. So recently my pick for the number one invention would have to  be the first agricultural revolution, the Neolithic package that led to  the formation of human civilizations. That’s what enabled the scaling of the collective intelligence machine of humanity, and for us to become  the early bootloader for the next 10,000 years of technological  progress, which yes, includes AI and the tech that builds on top of AI.  And of course it could be argued that the word invention doesn’t  properly apply to the agricultural revolution. I think actually Yuval  Noah Harari argues that it wasn’t the humans who were the inventors, but a handful of plant species, namely wheat, rice and potatoes. This is  strictly a fair perspective. But I’m having fun, like I said, with this  discussion. Here, I just think of the entire earth as a system that  continuously transforms. And I’m using the term invention in that  context. Asking the question of when was the biggest leap on the  log-scale plot of human progress?        

02:05:23: Will AI, AGI, ASI eventually take the  number one spot on this ranking? I think it has a very good chance to do so due again to the size of the network of inventions that will come  along with it. I think we discuss in this podcast the kind of things  that would be included in the so-called AI package. But I think there’s a lot more possibilities, including discussed in previous podcasts and  many previous podcasts, including with Dario Amodei, talking on the  biological innovation side, the science progress side. And this podcast, I think we talk about something that I’m particularly excited about in  the near term, which is unlocking the cognitive capacity of the entire  landscape of brains that is the human species. Making it more accessible through education and through machine translation, making information,  knowledge and the rapid learning and innovation process accessible to  more humans, to the entire 8 billion, if you will. So I do think  language or machine translation apply to all the different methods that  we use on the internet to discover knowledge is a big unlock. But there  are a lot of other stuff in the so-called AI package like discussed with Dario, curing all major human diseases. He really focuses on that in  The Machines of Love and Grace essay. I think there will be huge leaps  in productivity for human programmers and semi-autonomous human  programmers. So humans in the loop, but most of the programming is done  by AI agents. And then moving that towards a superhuman AI researcher  that’s doing the research that develops and programs the AI system in  itself. I think there’ll be huge transformative effects from autonomous  vehicles. These are the things that we maybe don’t immediately  understand, or we understand from an economics perspective, but there  will be a point when AI systems are able to interpret, understand,  interact with the human world to sufficient degree to where many of the  manually controlled human in the loop systems we rely on become fully  autonomous.        

02:07:43: And I think mobility is such a big  part of human civilization that there will be effects on that, that  they’re not just economic, but are social cultural and so on. And  there’s a lot more things I could talk about for a long time. So  obviously the integration utilization of AI in the creation of art,  film, music, I think the digitalization and automating basic functions  of government, and then integrating AI into that process, thereby  decreasing corruption and costs and increasing transparency and  efficiency. I think we as humans, individual humans, will continue to  transition further and further into cyborgs. There’s already a AI in the loop of the human condition, and that will become increasingly so as AI becomes more powerful. The thing I’m obviously really excited about is  major breakthroughs in science, and not just on the medical front but on fundamental physics, which would then lead to energy breakthroughs  increasing the chance that we become, we actually become a Kardashev  Type I civilization. And then enabling us in so doing to do interstellar exploration of space and colonization of space. I think there also in  the near term, much like with the industrial revolution that led to  rapid specialization of skills of expertise, there might be a great sort of de-specialization. So as the AI system become superhuman experts at  particular fields, there might be greater and greater value to being the integrator of AIs for humans to be generalists. And so the great value  of the human mind will come from the generalists, not the specialists.  That’s a real possibility that that changes the way we are about the  world, that we want to know a little bit of a lot of things and move  about the world in that way. That could have when passing a certain  threshold, a complete shift in who we are as a collective intelligence  as a human species. Also as an aside, when thinking about the invention  that was the greatest in human history, again for a bit of fun, we have  to remember that all of them build on top of each other.        

02:10:15: And so we need to look at the Delta,  the step change on the, I would say impossibly to perfectly measure plot of exponential human progress. Really we can go back to the entire  history of life on earth. And a previous podcast guest, Nick Lane does a great job of this in his book Life Ascending, listing these 10 major  inventions throughout the evolution of life on earth like DNA,  photosynthesis, complex cells, sex, movement, sight, all those kinds of  things. I forget the full list that’s on there. But I think that’s so  far from the human experience that my intuition about, let’s say  productivity multipliers of those particular inventions completely  breaks down, and a different framework is needed to understand the  impact of these inventions of evolution. The origin of life on Earth, or even the Big Bang itself of course is the OG invention that set the  stage for all the rest of it. And there are probably many more turtles  under that which are yet to be discovered.        

02:11:26: So anyway, we live in interesting  times, fellow humans. I do believe the set of positive trajectories for  humanity outnumber the set of negative trajectories, but not by much. So let’s not mess this up. And now let me leave you with some words from  French philosopher Jean de La Bruyère, “Out of difficulties, grow  miracles.” Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
