Telegram’s special [secret chats](https://telegram.org/faq#secret-chats) use end-to-end encryption, leave no trace on our servers, support  self-destructing messages and don’t allow forwarding. On top of this,  secret chats are not part of the Telegram cloud and can only be accessed on their devices of origin.

---

[Server-client encryption](https://core.telegram.org/mtproto) is used in Cloud Chats (private and group chats), Secret Chats use an additional layer of [client-client encryption](https://core.telegram.org/api/end-to-end). 

Our encryption is based on 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange.

Telegram supports [verifiable builds](https://telegram.org/blog/verifiable-apps-and-more), which allow experts to independently verify that our code published on GitHub is the **exact same code** that is used to build the apps you download from App Store or Google Play.

---

You can order your messages, photos, videos and files to [self-destruct](https://telegram.org/faq#q-how-do-self-destructing-messages-work) in a set amount of time after they have been read or opened by the  recipient. The message will then disappear from both your and your  friend's devices.

We can't help you unless you have access either to the phone number or to Telegram itself on any of your devices.
